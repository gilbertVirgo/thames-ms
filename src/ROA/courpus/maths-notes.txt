TYPES OF NUMBERS - contents Numbers fall into certain groups, some of which are given names:





Counting numbers : 1, 2, 3, 4, ...............

Natural numbers : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..............

Integers : .........., -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, .........





The above series of numbers all continue indefinitely.



Rational numbers are those which can be expressed as fractions, i.e. one number divided by another





Since dividing any number by 1 leaves the number unchanged, all the above numbers are rational numbers because we could express each one as, for example:



1/1, 2/1, 3/1 etc.





The following are also rational numbers:

Some numbers cannot be expressed as exact fractions. For example, we say that the square root of 9 is 3, because 3x 3=9. But what about the square root of, for example, 2? On the calculator you will get something like:



The decimal places carry on forever without repeating, which means that the number cannot be expressed as a fraction, i.e. it is not a rational number. Hence, we describe the square root of 2 is an irrational number .





Rational and irrational numbers together form what are called real numbers





Any real number, rational or irrational, can be located on the real number line - this is represented below - it extends forever to right and left:

Changing a recurring decimal into a fraction This is illustrated with a couple of examples:

Example



Example





Arithmetic

Arithmetic is the branch of maths concerned with numerical calculations.

There are four basic operations with numbers :





Addition , which produces the sum of two numbers:





The sum of 2 and 5 equals 7, which we write as: 2 + 5 = 7



Subtraction , which produces the difference between two numbers:





The difference between 9 and 5 is 4, which we write as: 9 - 5 = 4



Multiplication , which produces the product of two numbers:





The product of 3 and 4 is 12, which we write as: 3 * 4 = 12[Again note that we here use the star (*) to stand for 'times' or 'multiply by' - whereas by hand we would usually write a cross ( x )]





Division , which produces the quotient of two numbers:





* * *





DIRECTED NUMBERS - start of this chapter - contents Directed numbers are positive or negative numbers. When you add, subtract, multiply or divide directed numbers, you are moving from one point to another along the number line:





The four basic operations with directed numbers can be considered in pairs: 1. Addition and subtraction





1 + 3 = 4. We can think of this as an instruction to start at number +1 on the number line, then move 3 in the positive direction, bringing us to number +4

2 - 5 = -3. We can think of this as an instruction to start at number +2, then move 5 in the negative direction, bringing us to number -3

-2 + 5 = 3. We can think of this as an instruction to start at number -2, then move 5 in the positive direction, bringing us to number +3





Notice that:



If there is no sign put in front of a number then it is positive. E.g. 1 and 2 mean +1 and +2

It may help to change the order of the numbers. E.g. -2 + 5 is the same as +5 -2 = 3





What would, for example, 3 - (-4) mean? The rule here is that:



When two minus signs occur together, change them into a plus , so: 3 - (-4) = 3 + 4 = 7





Other examples:





-5 - 2 = -7

-2 + 7 = 7 - 2 = 5

3 + 5 - 6 = 8 - 6 = 2

5 - (-4) = 5 + 4 = 9





With practice, it is not necessary to think in terms of the number line in order to work out the answers. Example

What is the increase in temperature if it rises from -10o F (F=Fahrenheit) to 65o F?





increase = final value - initial value = 65 - (-10) = 65 + 10 = 75o F





2. Multiplication and division



When we multiply or divide two numbers, we have to take into account their signs. When two numbers are multiplied or divided:





the answer is positive if both number have the same sign (both + or both -)

the answer is negative if they have opposite signs (one is + and the other is -)





Again, remember that if a number is not written with a sign, then it is taken as being positive:



3 * 3 = (+3) * (+3) = + 9

(-3) * (-3) = + 9

3 * (-3) = (+3) * (-3) = -9

(-3) * 3 = (-3) * (+3) = -9

6/(-2) = - 3

(-6)/2 = -3

(-6)/(-3) = +2





So,



a plus and a plus give a plus

a minus and a minus give a plus

a plus and a minus give a minus





If there are several numbers to multiply or divide, you can deal with them two at a time. For example:



3 * (-4) * (-5) = (-12) * (-5) = + 60





Order of operations

If you enter the following on your calculator, you should get the result shown:





10 - 2*3 = 10 - 6 = 4





On the calculator, the sequence is:



clear the calculator

enter 10

press -

enter 2

press x (the multiply button)

enter 3

press =





You should get the answer 4.Try the following on a calculator (for the stroke /, press the divide button):





3*4/2 - 9/3 = 6 - 3 = 3





The calculator performs multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. For example, in the first calculation, it works out 2*3 = 6 and then works out 10 - 6 = 4.

Suppose that in the first example, that we really wanted the calculator to work out (10 - 2) and then multiply by 3. We would write this as:





(10 - 2)*3 = 8*3 = 24





On the calculator the sequence is:



press ( [open bracket]

enter 10

press -

enter 2

press ) [closed bracket]

press x (the multiply button)

enter 3

press =





You should get the answer 24.The above are examples of applying the BODMAS rule. This stands for:





Brackets Off

Division/Multiplication

Addition/Subtraction





This is intended as a reminder of the order numerical operations are performed. The contents of brackets are dealt with first, and divisions and multiplications are done before additions and subtractions.

THE DECIMAL SYSTEM - start of this chapter - contents The decimal number system is based on the number 10 - presumably it developed because we have 10 digits (fingers and thumbs).

The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are referred to as digits .

When we write a number such as 457 we are using a shorthand notation:

457 = 400 + 50 + 7 = 4 hundreds + 5 tens + 7 units

When we write a number such as 0.637, again we are using a shorthand notation:





The dot is called the decimal point (sometimes, we may use a dash (-), especially on cheques)

The figures after the decimal point are decimal places





The decimal places are fractions with a multiple of 10 on the bottom (the denominator):



Multiplying and dividing by multiples of 10

An advantage of the decimal system is that it is very easy to multiply or divide by a multiple of 10 - we simply move the decimal point to the right or left.

When multiplying by 10 or 100 or 1000 etc., we move the decimal point to the right by the number of zeros:





345.678 * 10 = 3456.78 (1 zero in 10, so we move the decimal point 1 place to the right)

345.678 * 100 = 34567.8 (2 zeros in 100 so we move the decimal point 2 places to the right)

345 * 100 = 34500 (if a decimal point is not shown, it is at the end: 345 *100 = 345.0 *100 = 34500)





When dividing by 10 or 100 or 1000 etc., we move the decimal point to the left by the number of zeros:



345.6/10 = 34.56 (1 zero in 10, so we move the decimal point 1 place to the left)

345.6/100 = 3.456 (2 zeros in 100 so we move the decimal point 2 places to the left)

0.34/100 = 0.0034

34/1000 = 0.034 (if a decimal point is not shown, it is at the end: 34/1000 = 34.0/1000 = 0.034)





Note that 0.1 = 1/10 , 0.01 = 1/100 etc., so, for example:



345.6*0.1 = 345.6/10 = 34.56





Addition

As an example, we work out: 378 + 267



In the next example, the numbers to be added have decimal places. In this case, we put the decimal points directly under each other, and put a decimal point in the answer directly under them - then we add the two numbers in the same way as before.

We work out: 725.85 + 539.4 (notice below that we add an extra zero after the .4 - this is not essential, but it may help if both numbers have the same number of decimal places):





Subtraction

As an example, we work out: 486 - 157



When the two numbers have decimal places, we put the decimal points directly under each other, and put a decimal point in the answer directly under them - then we subtract the two numbers in the same way as before.





Long Multiplication

As an example, we work out: 347 * 25





Long division





It may be that remainder never reaches zero - in which case the division is continued until a desired number of decimal places have been produced.

Note:

It is usually easier to divide by whole numbers. So if you were dividing, for example, 46.28 by 3.7, first of all multiply both numbers by 10, so you are then dividing 462.8 by the whole number 37.

NUMBER PATTERNS

FACTORS AND MULTIPLES

FRACTIONS





* * *





NUMBER PATTERNS - contents Even numbers

All these can be divided exactly by 2:

2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ........

If we represent these as below, we can see that there is a general rule for finding an even number:



In words, we see that:





the 1st even number = 2 = 2 * 1

the 2nd even number = 4 = 2 * 2

the 3rd even number = 6 = 2 * 3



The nth even number = 2*n which we write as 2n





We can replace the n by any whole number to produce an even number:



For example, when n = 43, then 2n is the even number 2*43 = 86





Odd numbers

None of these can be divided exactly by 2:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, .........

If we represent these as below, we can see that there is a general rule for finding an odd number:



In words, we see that:





the 1st odd number = 1 = (2 * 1) - 1 [the bracket is to shows that the * is done before the -]

the 2nd odd number = 3 = (2 * 2) - 1

the 3rd odd number = 5 = (2 * 3) - 1



The nth odd number = (2*n) - 1 which we write as 2n - 1





We can replace the n by any whole number to produce an odd number:



For example, when n = 43, then 2n -1 is the odd number 2*43 - 1 = 86 - 1 = 85





Square numbers

1, 4, 9, 16, .... are square numbers:

Below shows the notation we use for 'one squared', 'two squared', etc..





1 = 1 squared = 1*1 = 12

4 = 2 squared = 2*2 = 22

9 = 3 squared = 3*3 = 32

16 = 4 squared = 4*4 = 42 etc.

The nth square number = n2





We could represent the pattern, or sequence, as:



Cube numbers

1, 8, 27, 64,... are cube numbers:





1 = 1 cubed = 1*1*1 = 13

8 = 2 cubed = 2*2*2 = 23

27 = 3 cubed = 3*3*3 = 33

64 = 4 cubed = 4*4*4 = 43

The nth cube number = n3





Triangular numbers

These can be represented by triangles made up of the appropriate number of dots:





Prime numbers

A prime number is any number, greater than 1, that can only be divided exactly by itself and 1:

2, 3, 5, 7, .....................

There is not a general rule for working out the nth prime number.



Number sequences are not necessarily whole number sequences, as the next example indicates.





* * *





FACTORS AND MULTIPLES - start of this chapter - contents



a factor of a number is any integer that divides into the number exactly (i.e. with no remainder)





The factors of 6 are: 1, 2, 3 and 6. (Because 6/1 = 6, 6/2 = 3, 6/3 = 2, 6/6 = 1)



a multiple of a number is that number multiplied by any integer





Some multiples of 6 are: 6, 12, 18, 24, ....... (These are 1*6, 2*6, 3*6, 4*6, ......)Now compare the factors of 6 with the factors of 15, which are: 1, 3, 5 and 15

We see that some factors (1 and 3) the same, i.e. they are common factors of both 6 and 15.





The highest common factor ('HCF') of two or more numbers is the highest factor common to the numbers





The HCF of 6 and 15 is 3.The factors of a number always include 1 and the number itself, but most numbers have other factors as well, as we've seen for 6 and 15. However:





A prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself - these are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, ....





Writing a number as a product of prime factors

Recall that:





a factor of a number is any integer that divides into the number exactly

a prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, ....





Hence:



a prime facto r is a factor which is also a prime number





We can express any number as a product of its prime factors. Suppose we want to express 12 as a product of its prime factors. We do this by dividing by prime numbers as often as possible, starting with 2 - hence:



dividing 12 by 2 gives 6

dividing 6 by 2 gives 3 - we cannot divide 3 by 2, so we go to the next prime number, which is 3

dividing 3 by 3 gives 1 (when we reach 1 we stop)





We've divided by 2 twice and by 3 once, so 12 = 2*2*3 = 22 *3



Note: 22 is a shorthand way of writing 2*2. We say 22 as '2 to the power 2' - this notation is discussed more later.





Example Express 90 as a product of its prime factors.





dividing by 2 gives 45 - this will not divide by 2, so

dividing 45 by 3 gives 15

dividing 15 by 3 gives 5 - this will not divide by 3, so

dividing 5 by 5 gives 1





We've divided by 2 once, by 3 twice and by 5 once, so 90 = 2*3*3*5 = 2*32 *5

Lowest common multiple ('LCM')





The lowest common multiple of two or more numbers is the lowest number that they will both divide into exactly





There are several ways of finding the LCM of two or more numbers: Method 1 :

Suppose that we want the LCM of 3 and 5. One way is to list the first few multiples of each number:



The lists could be continued indefinitely. We see that the first two common multiples of 3 and 5 are 15 and 30.

The lower of these is 15, so 15 is therefore the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5.

Method 2 :

Another way to get the LCM of two or more numbers is to:





multiply the numbers together, which will produces a multiple of all the numbers, then

see if the multiple can be reduced to a lower multiple by dividing it by 2 or 3 etc.





For example, 2, 3 and 4 multiplied together give 2*3*4 = 24. So, 24 is a common multiple of 2, 3, and 4 since each will divide into 24. Now, dividing 24 by 2 gives us 12, and this can also be divided by 2, 3 and 4. If we divide 12 any more, all three numbers will not divide into it, which means that 12 is the lowest common multiple of 2, 3 and 4. Method 3 :

We can also find the lowest common multiple of two or more numbers by expressing each number as a product of its primes factors.

Suppose that we want the LCM of 12 and 90.

We already have seen that: 12 = 22 *3 and 90 = 2*32 *5

To get the LCM of 12 and 90 we just multiply the prime factors from either number with the highest power:





the highest power of 2 is 22

the highest power of 3 is 32

the highest power of 5 is 51 , i.e. simply 5 ( 51 is the same as 5)





The LCM of 12 and 90 is the product of these, so the LCM of 12 and 90 = 22 *32 *5 = 4*9*5 = 180.



To check that 180 is a multiple of 12 and 90, we divide it: 180/12 = 15 and 180/90= 2

Also, 180 is the lowest multiple since, if we try to reduce it by dividing it by 2, say, we get 90 - but 12 does not divide into 90





We can use LCMs when we want to combine fractions - as shown in the next section.



* * *





FRACTIONS - start of this chapter - contents





A fraction is a part of something





The bottom number (the denominator ) says how many equal parts the whole pie is divided into

The top number (the numerator ) says how many equal parts of the whole pie are taken





Since the above pie is divided into 8 parts, then:

1/8 means that 1 of the 8 equal parts of the pie is taken

3/8 means that 3 of the 8 equal parts of the pie are taken

8/8 means that all 8 equal parts are taken - the whole pie



A general rule:



the value of a fraction remains the same if its numerator and denominator are multiplied or divided by the same quantity





For example, multiplying top and bottom of 1/8 by 2 gives 2/16, and these fraction are the same since:



taking 1 part of a pie divided into 8 equal parts is just the same as taking two parts of a pie divided into 16 equal parts





Also, for example, dividing top and bottom of 6/8 by 2 gives 3/4, and these fraction are the same since:



taking 6 parts of a pie divided into 8 equal parts is just the same as taking 3 parts of a pie divided into 4 equal parts





Proper and improper fractions

3/8 is and example of a proper fraction - the top number is less than the bottom number, and so the fraction has a value less than 1 (3/8 = 0.375).

13/8 is and example of an improper fraction - the top number is bigger than the bottom number, and so the fraction has a value greater than 1 (13/8 = 1.625).

An improper fraction can be expressed as a mixed number, which is a whole number and a proper fraction.



Reducing a fraction to its lowest terms



To change 4/8 to 1/2 we divide both the top and bottom by 2 and then by 2 again.

Simplifying a fraction in this way is called reducing a fraction to its lowest terms or to its simplest form .

To reduce a fraction to its lowest terms:





divide the top and bottom by 2 as often as possible

then divide by 3 as often as possible

then divide by 5 as often as possible, etc...





Example



As a check , calculate 60/144 and 5/12 on a calculator



Comparing fractions

Which fraction is bigger, 3/5 or 4/7 ?

To compare different fractions, or to put them in order of size, it is easiest if they all have the same denominator , since then we only need to look at the size of their numerators.

So, to compare fractions:





find the LCM of (all) the denominators

change all the fractions so they all have this LCM as their denominator (it is then called their 'lowest common denominator ', LCD)





Recall that one way to get the LCM of two or more numbers is to:



multiply the numbers together, which will produces a multiple of all the numbers, then

see if the multiple can be reduced to a lower multiple by dividing it by 2 or 3 etc.





Comparing the numerators, since 21 is bigger than 20, then 21/35 is bigger than 20/35, so 3/5 is bigger than 4/7.

As a check , on your calculator calculate 3/5 and 21/35 to see that they are the same, and calculate 4/7 and 20/35 to see that they are the same.



Combining fractions

A half plus a quarter equals three quarters. In symbols, 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.

To produce the answer 3/4, the 1/2 has been changed to 2/4 and then added to the 1/4.

This is an example of a general rule - in order to combine the fractions:





make their denominators the same (by finding their LCM), and then

add their numerators





Example

We see that 2*3 = 6, which is the LCM of 2 and 3:





2 goes 3 times into 6, so multiply top and bottom of 1/2 by 3

3 goes 2 times into 6, so multiply top and bottom of 1/3 by 2





Now the fractions have a common denominator, 6, and we can add their numerators:



At this stage, check to see if the answer can be simplified - by dividing top and bottom by 2 or 3 etc., if possible (in this example it cannot).

As a check , work out (1/2 + 1/3) and then 5/6 on a calculator (you can do this check for the next example too).

Example



The process is just the same for subtracting two fractions:

PERCENTAGES

INDICES

ROOTS





* * *





PERCENTAGES - contents As mentioned before, if we have a pie and divide it into 8 equal parts, then we can have 1/8 or 3/8 etc. of that pie. We say that 1/8 etc. is a fraction of the whole pie.

Now, the word 'percent ' means 'per hundred' or 'out of 100'.

So, when dealing with percentages, we think of the pie (or anything else) as being divided into 100 equals parts, and a stated percentage is a particular number of those parts.

So, for example, 50 percent (written as 50%) means '50 out of 100 equal parts', which is the same as the fraction 50/100 which equals 1/2 which is 0.5

Hence, a percentage is just a special fraction, in which an item is thought of as being divided into 100 equal parts.

Remember that in order to compare different fractions, we had to change them so that they had the same bottom (the same denominator). A useful thing about percentages is that they always have the same bottom, i.e. 100. So we can easily compare different percentages.

We can see at once that, for example, 50% of a pie is bigger than 49% of the pie which is bigger than 25% of the pie etc. Or, for example, a 40% discount off the price of a pair of jeans is better than a 10% discount. Notice that percentages are always percentages of something in particular - a pie, the price of a pair of jeans etc.

Using percentages makes calculations easier. For one thing we can easily change a percentage into an ordinary decimal. For example, 45% means 45/100, which is 0.45. So we simply move the decimal point two positions to the left.

So, for example:





75% = 75/100 = 0.75

32% = 32/100 = 0.32

10% = 10/100 = 0.10

4% = 4/100 = 0.04 (not 0.4, which is 40%)



Example What is 60% of £20?

To turn this into the form of a calculation:

replace 60% with 60/100 = 0.60, and

replace of with multiply





So, 60% of 20 = 0.60 * 20 = 12So, 60% of £20 is £12.

Example

What is 75% of 40 cans of pop?

75% of 40 = 0.75 * 40 = 30

So, 75% 0f 40 cans is 30 cans.

Example

A pair of jeans is priced at £36. They are on special offer with a 60% discount. What is the selling price?

Firstly, what it the discount?

60% of 36 = 0.60 * 36 = 21.6

21.6 is the same as 21.60, so the discount is £21.60

So, the selling price is 36 - 21.60 = 14.4

So, the selling price is £14.40



Calculating a percentage

What is 16 as a percentage of 128? To calculate this, we divide the 16 by 128 and multiply the result by 100.



So, 16 is 12.5% of 128.

We can check that the answer is correct:

12.5% of 128 = 0.125 * 128 = 16.

Example

A TV is priced at £200. It is decided to reduce it by £30. What is the percentage discount?



As a check:

15 % of 200 = 0.15 * 200 = 30

Example

What is 30p as a percentage of £3.

In this sort of calculation both quantities must have the same units .

There are 100 pence in £1, so there are 300 pence in £3. We can now calculate the % as:



So, 30 pence is 10% of £3.



Increasing by a percentage

Example

A computer is priced at £800, not including 17.5% VAT.

What is the selling price with VAT included?

17.5% of 800 = 0.175 * 800 = 140

So, the selling price = £800 + £140 = £940

Note - when something has to be increased by a certain percentage, a quick way to do it is:





convert the percentage increase to a decimal

add this to 1 so you get 'one point something'

multiply the original number by this 'one point something'





In the above example:



17.5% = 17.5/100 = 0.175

1 + 0.175 = 1.175

800*1.175 = £940





Example Increase 450 kg by 26%.





26% = 0.26

1 + 0.26 = 1.26

so the answer is 450*1.26 = 567 kg





Example An 80 pence box of cereals increases in price by 5%. What is the new price?





5% = 5/100 = 0.05 ( not 0.5, which is 50%)

1+ 0.05 = 1.05

so the new price is 80 * 1.05 = 84 pence





Decreasing by a percentage

Note:





appreciation is when something's value increases with time - e.g. many art works and houses appreciate

depreciation is when something's value decreases with time - e.g. most cars depreciate





Example A car is bought for £15000, and a year later has lost 10% of its original value. What is its new value?





10% of 15000 = (10/100) * 15000 = 0.10 * 15000 = 1500

new value = 15000 - 1500 = £13500





Note - as with percentage increases, there is a quick way to do a percentage decrease:



convert the percentage decrease to a decimal

take this off 1, to give 'nought point something'

multiply the original number by this 'nought point something'





In the above example:



10% = 10/100 = 0.10

1 - 0.10 = 0.90

New value after a year = 15000*0.90 = £13500





Be careful if the depreciation is less than 10%. Suppose that it had been 5% during the year:



5% = 5/100 = 0.05 (not 0.5, which is 50%)

1 - 0.05 = 0.95

New value after a year = 15000*0.95 = £14250

INDICES - start of this chapter - contents



3*3 is written as 32 , and is said as '3 squared' or '3 to the power 2'

5*5*5 is written as 53 , and is said as '5 cubed' or '5 to the power 3'





In a number expressed like 32 :



the 3 is called the base number and

the 2 is called the index of 3 or the power of 3 (we say that 3 is raised to the power 2)





The index tell you how many times the base is multiplied by itself.So, 32 tells you that 3 is multiplied by itself 2 times. The value of 3 squared, 32 = 3*3 = 9

So, 53 tells you that 5 is multiplied by itself 3 times. The value of 5 cubed, 53 = 5*5*5 = 125

Any number raised to the power 1 is unchanged. So, 31 is the same as 3.

Example: What is the value of 26 ?

26 = 2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64

Using a calculator - You may have a calculator with a button marked with yx (or something similar). This can be used to work out numbers which have powers. The 'y' represents a base number and the 'x' represents the power (or index). In the above case, firstly clear your calculator or turn it off and on, then:





enter 2 (the base)

press the yx button

enter 6 (the power)

press equals - you should get the answer 64





Multiplying numbers that have indices

Notice that in the previous example we could bracket the six 2s in different ways:





2 * (2*2*2*2*2), which equals 21 *25

(2*2) * (2*2*2*2), which equals 22 *24

(2*2*2) * (2*2*2), which equals 23 *23





In all three cases the powers add up to 6, so:



21 *25 = 2(1+5) = 26 = 64

22 *24 = 2(2+4) = 26 = 64

23 *23 = 2(3+3) = 26 = 64





The base is the same, i.e. 2, in each of the above, and we get the general rule that:



to multiply two numbers with the same base we add together their indices (their powers)





Example : What is the value of 22 *23 *21 We could do this as:

22 *23 *21 = 4*8*2 = 64

Or, we could add the powers to get:

22 *23 *21 = 2(2+3+1) = 26 =64



Dividing numbers that have indices



Notice that the answer, 2*2*2*2 = 24 = 2(6-2)

It is a general rule that:





to divide two numbers with the same base we subtract their indices





Example

Example



Notice that:





we can only combine powers for numbers with the same base - so we dealt with the numbers with base 2 separately from those with base 3





Powers raised to powers

Consider: (24 )3

The 3 outside the bracket means that the quantity inside has to be multiplied by itself 3 times

So, (24 )3 = 24 *24 *24 = 2(4+4+4) = 212 = 4096 (check this on your calculator)

Notice that the final power, 12, equals 4*3, which is the original two powers multiplied together. This is a general rule:





When a number with a power is raised to a power, multiply the powers together





So, we could have written the calculation as:So, (24 )3 = 2(4*3) = 212 = 4096



The power zero





Any number to the power zero equals one





No matter whether it is big, little, positive or negative, if a number is raised to the power 0 then it equals 1.



10 = 1

20 = 1

(-2)0 = 1 (some calculators, incorrectly , give an error message when you do this one or the next)

(-30)0 = 1

20000 = 1

22793794880 = 1





Reciprocal (or inverse)





The reciprocal of a number is one divided by that number





So, 2-1 , '2 to the power minus 1', stands for the reciprocal of 2, i.e.1/2.Similarly, 3-1 = 1/3

Notice also that, for example:



Thus, a minus power, means one over a positive power.





* * *





ROOTS - start of this chapter - contents Square roots

22 = 2*2 = 4. We say that 4 = 2 squared. We also say that 2 is the square root of 4.

Also, since a minus times a minus gives a plus, (-2)*(-2) = 4. So, -2 is also the square root of 4. So,

the square root of 4 is either +2 or -2





We express the square root of 4 in two ways:

You can check these on your calculator - the following should both produce the answer 2:



A calculator will usually give the positive square root, i.e. 2. The other root is the negative of this, i.e. -2.

Example

What are the square roots of: 25, 81, 16?



Example





Cube roots

23 = 2*2*2 = 8. We say that 8 = 2 cubed. We also say that 2 is the cube root of 8.

This time, the negative value is not a cube root, since (-2)*(-2)*(-2)= -8, not +8.

Again, we can write the cube root of 8 in two ways:



Again, the yx button on a calculator can be used to check that 81/3 equals 2. To get the exact answer, you need to be careful how you enter the 1/3, since remember that it is 0.333333......One way is to put the 1/3 inside brackets - try the following:



As a check, when you work out a cube root of a number, cubing the answer should give you the original number.

For example, we find that 81/3 = 2. Then, as a check we calculate 23 , which equals 8.



Other roots

The fourth root, fifth root etc. are written with symbols similar to the cube root, and calculated in a similar manner.

Example

Write down two expressions for the fifth root of 243, and determine its value.

The fifth root of 243 can be written as:



We can check the answer as described earlier, i.e. by working out 35 . This equals 243, as expected.



Combining numbers which have fractional indices

The rules for whole number indices also apply when the powers are fractions:

Example



Sometimes we have letters standing for various quantities, but the rules for indices still apply:

Example





Surds

We can write the following to as many decimal places as we wish, but we cannot write them as exact decimals and we cannot write them as fractions:





Numbers which cannot be written as fractions are called irrational numbers, so the square roots of 2, 3 and 5 (and others) are irrational numbers.



1. Simplifying expressions containing surds

Example

Express the following in terms of the simplest possible surds:





Note - as a check, you can work out the values of the original and final expressions on a calculator, to ensure that they are the same.



2. Rationalising a denominator



Now, if surds occur on the bottom (the denominator) of a fraction, we can sometimes modify the fraction to change the surds in the denominator into rational numbers, a process called rationalising the denominator - as in the following example:

Example



We decide what needs to be done to the denominator to turn it into a rational number, and then do this to top and bottom - so in this case:.

STANDARD FORM

APPROXIMATIONS

PROPORTIONAL DIVISION

DIRECT AND INVERSE PROPORTION





* * *





STANDARD FORM - contents Expressing a number in standard form means writing it as:





a number between 1 and 10, multiplied by a power of ten





Standard form (also called 'scientific notation') is especially useful when dealing with very large or very small numbers.



Consider a large number, like 678 000 000 000





The decimal point is not usually shown in a whole number, but it is actually at the end, so: 678 000 000 000 is the same as 678 000 000 000.0

In this case the required number between 1 and 10 is 6.78, and to get this number we have to move the decimal point by 11 positions to the left, and so 11 is the required power of 10.

So, 678 000 000 000 = 6.78 * 1011 in standard form.





Now consider a small number, like: 0.000 000 17





In this case the required number between 1 and 10 is 1.7, and to get this number we have to move the decimal point by 7 places to the right. We write this as a negative power of 10. So,



0.000 000 17 = 1.7 * 10-7





Example The speed of light is 300 000 000 metres per second (m/s). Express this in standard form.

300 000 000 is the same as 30 000 000.0

The required number between 1 and 10 is 3.0, and to get this we move the decimal point 8 places to the left. So,

300 000 000 m/s = 3.0 * 108 m/s in standard form.

Example

Multiply 2*108 by 4*103

The rules for multiplying numbers with indices apply to the powers of 10:





2*108 *4*103 = 2*4*108 *103 = 8*108+3 = 8*1011





Using a calculator, when you enter 2*108 , you do not need to actually enter the 10:



enter 2

press EXP

enter 8





The display on a calculator may depend on its 'mode' setting.If it is not set to display 'standard form', the display may look like:





If it is set to display standard form, then the display may look like:

Both these stand for 2*108 .

After the previous step, i.e. entering the 8 on your calculator, now:





press (x) (the multiply button)

enter 4

press EXP

enter 3

press equals





You should get the answer:

You should always put the base number 10 in a written answer , even if it is not displayed on your calculator:





Both the above represent: 8*1011 ('8 times 10 to the power 11').





Example Evaluate 2.7*108 * 3.2*10-3

On the calculator:





enter 2.7

press EXP

enter 8

press x (multiply)

enter 3.2

press EXP

enter 3

press +/- (this changes the power 3 to -3)

press equals





You should get: 8.64*105 or 864000Note: Some numbers that occur in science are extremely large or extremely small. For example:





the mass of the Earth = 6.0*1024 kg

the mass of a proton = 1.7*10-27 kg





It would be very awkward to deal with numbers like these without using standard form notation.



* * *





APPROXIMATIONS - start of this chapter - contents Decimal places (d.p.s)

If you work out the square root of 2 and 5 on a calculator, you will get something like:



Usually, we do not need to write a number with lots of decimal places. Rather we round a number (or 'correct' it) to 1 or 2 or 3 decimal places.

If, for example, we only want two decimal places, then we look at the next decimal place along, i.e. the third decimal place:





if the third decimal place is less than 5, we leave the second decimal place as it is

if the third decimal place is 5 or more then we increase the second decimal place by 1





Note the following - suppose that we want to express 3.6497 to 3 decimal places:

We look at the 4th d.p., which is 7. So we increase the 3rd d.p. by 1. But 9 +1 is 10. In this situation:

we change the 9 to a 0, and increase the previous number by 1, i.e. change the 4 to a 5





So, 3.6497 = 3.650 (to 3 d.p.)

Significant figures (s.f.s)

Consider the number 482.62

We could write this as: 482.62000000000000000000000000000000.........................

However, the extra zeros do not tell us anything, so we say that they are not significant.

We say that 482.62 is stated to 5 significant figures.

If we only want four significant figure, we look at the fifth figure:

if the fifth figure is less than 5, leave the 4th figure as it is

if the fifth figure is 5 or more increase the 4th figure by 1





So, since the fifth figure (the 2) is less than 5, then to 4 significant figures, the number equals 482.6We say that we have 'rounded' or 'corrected' the number to 4 significant figures, and we may write it as: 482.6 to 4 s.f.

In the same way, the number equals:





483 to 3 s.f.s (we've increased the 2 to a 3, since the next figure was a 6)

480 to 2 s.f.s

500 to 1 s.f.s





Approximate answers

Does 9.875 * 5.123 = 505.9?

We can see that this cannot be correct, because the answer must be about 10*5 = 50.

It is sometimes useful to be able to make an estimate of an answer. In the above case, perhaps the first figure was entered in the calculator as 98.75 by mistake - the approximate answer reveals that a mistake has been made.

When estimating an answer, we may round figures to the nearest 1 or 10 or 100 etc. Sometimes we approximate figures to a certain number of decimal places or to a certain number of significant figures.

Example

Estimate 42*97/9

Rounding each figure to the nearest ten gives us 40*100/10 = 4000/10 = 400

Example

Find an approximate value of 427*52 by correcting the numbers to one significant figure.

Correcting each number to one significant figure, 427*52 is about 400*50 = 20000



Accuracy of measurements

When dealing with money, prices are often rounded up or down to a whole pence, since there is no coin smaller than a whole pence. However, the rounding is not always to the nearest whole pence, since this may cost someone money.

For example, a grocer sells bags containing 16 apples for £1-50 (we often use a dash for the decimal point when talking about money). How much would he probably charge for one apple?





Each apple works out at £1-50/16 = 150p/16 = 9.375pence. If he charged 9pence he would be making a loss (someone could buy 16 apples at 9p and only pay £1-44 in total) - so he would probably round the price up to 10pence each apple (he would then get £1-60 for 16 individual apples).





Rounding numbers up or down is commonly done when measurements are taken:The pencil in the diagram is 6.4cm long, to the nearest 0.1cm.



A measured length stated as 6.4cm means that:





if the length appeared to be 6.35cm or above it was rounded up to 6.4cm, or

if it appeared to be less than 6.45cm its was rounded down to 6.4cm





Whenever a measurement is quoted, the last figure has usually been rounded up or down to the nearest whole number. Thus, a length stated as 6.4 cm actually means that the length is somewhere between 6.35cm and 6.45cm.Suppose now that a metre ruler was used to measure the sides of a piece of paper, in order to work out its area, and it was found that:





length = 12.4 cm (so the length was between 12.35cm and 12.45cm)

width = 8.7 cm (so the width was between 8.65cm and 8.75cm)





Ordinarily we would simply work out the area as = 12.4 * 8.7 = 107.9 cm2 to 1d.p.However, what if we take in to account the uncertainty in the measured values?





If we use the smallest values, we get the area = 12.35*8.65 = 106.8cm2

If we use the largest values, we get the area = 12.45*8.75 = 108.9cm2





So we see that the uncertainly in the individual measurements produces an uncertainly in the result - this is an important consideration for engineers, for example.



* * *





PROPORTIONAL DIVISION - start of this chapter - contents





Proportional division means sharing or dividing something(s) in a given ratio





Suppose that we are to divide 20 cans of pop in the ratio 2 to 3 (written as 2:3) between John and Sue.Adding the numbers in the ratio tells us how many equals parts to divide the 20 cans into:





2 + 3 = 5, so there are 5 equal parts, and each part equals 20/5 = 4 cans





John gets 2 sets of these, so he gets 2*4 = 8 cans.Sue gets 3 sets of these, so she gets 3*4 = 12 cans.

As a check, 8 cans + 12 cans = 20 cans, the original number.



Producing a ratio

We can do the reverse of the above, i.e. if told how many cans each person has, we can work out the ratio.

So, the question would be, if John had 8 cans of pop and Sue has 12 cans, what is the ratio of John's cans to Sue's cans?

The ratio can immediately be written as 8:12

To simplify this as much as possible, we divide both numbers until we cannot divide any more, as below:





Dividing both by 2 gives the ratio 4:6

Dividing both again by 2 gives the ratio 2:3





We cannot divide any further, so the ratio of John's cans to Sue's is 2:3 (the same as above).

DIRECT AND INVERSE PROPORTION - start of this chapter - contents Direct proportion

If one bottle of milk is 30p, then two bottles are 60p and 3 bottles are 90p etc.





When quantities increase at the same rate we say that they are in direct proportion, or that they are directly proportional to each other





The number of bottles of milk and the total price paid are in direct proportion:cost of 2 bottles = 2 * cost of one bottle

cost of 3 bottles = 3 * cost of one bottle etc....

In general, if one quantity y is in direct proportion to another quantity x, we express this in symbols as:

We can replace the proportional symbol by an equals sign if we add a 'constant of proportionality', which we will here call k:



We can use any corresponding values of y and x to calculate k using k = y/x.

Then we can use y = kx to find y for any x value.

Example

Suppose that 5 apples cost 75p. How much would 8 apples cost.

Let y = kx, where y = cost of x apples. Given that when y = 75p, then x = 5, then:





k = y/x = 75/5 = 15p (price per apple)

y = 15x, so when x = 8, y = 15*8 = 120 pence (=£1-20)





Inverse proportion

Suppose that you walk to town, and it takes you 30 minutes. If you walked twice as fast, then it would take you 15 minutes. So when the speed increases the time taken decreases.

We say that the speed and the time to cover a given distance are in inverse proportion, or that they are inversely proportional to each other.

In general, if one quantity y is in inverse proportion to another quantity x, we express this in symbols as:



As before, we can replace the proportional symbol by an equals sign if we add a constant of proportionality, which we will again call k:



We can use any corresponding values of y and x to calculate k.

Example

Two ground staff take 3 hours to cut the grass on football pitch. How long would 5 ground staff take for the same job?

If the staff were doubled, we would expect the time taken to be halved, so the number of staff and the time taken are in inverse proportion.

Now, we don't have to use y and x to represent the variables. Suppose in this case that we let:





N = number of staff, and

T = time taken for the job





Then, T = k/N. Given that T = 3 hours when N = 2, then:



k = NT = 2*3 = 6, so

T = 6/N, so when N = 5, T = 6/5 = 1.2 hours





There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1.2 hours = 1.2*60 = 72 minutes.So, 5 ground staff would take 72 minutes to cut the grass.

PAY

TAX

HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES





* * *





PAY - contents Hourly pay

1. Peter works in a factory and is paid at £4-00 per hour. How much does he earn for a 40 hour week?

Pay = number of hours * hourly rate = 40 * 4 = £160

Note - £160 is referred to as his 'gross pay' - before any stoppages (tax etc.)



2. Sue gets paid £57.60 for 16 hours in a part-time job. What is her hourly rate of pay?

Hourly rate of pay = total pay = 57-10 = £3-60 per hour

number of hours worked 16



Overtime

Overtime is any time worked beyond a certain number of basic hours, often 40 hours.

Overtime is often paid at:





'time and a quarter' - for example, for 4 hours overtime, 5 hours are paid (5 = 4*1.25)

'time and a half' - for example, for 4 hours overtime, 6 hours are paid (6 = 4*1.5)

'double time' - for example, for 4 hours overtime, 8 hours are paid (8 = 4*2)





Example Peter gets paid £4-00 for his first 40 hours of work and gets paid time and a half for overtime. One week he does 50 hours of work. How much is his gross pay?

We need to work out the pay for the basic hours and then the extra pay for the overtime:





basic pay = 40 * 4 = £160

for 10 overtime, Peter gets paid for 10*1.5 = 15 hours pay = 15 * 4 = £60

total pay = 160 + 60 = £220





Example Eleanor's basic hourly rate is £5.20.

One week she does 6 hour 30 minutes overtime which is paid at time and a half.

How much is her overtime pay?





There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 30 minutes = 20/60 = 0.5 hours

So her overtime is 6.5 hours

6.5 hours at time and a half is 6.5*1.5 = 9.75 hours

9.75 hours at £5.20 per hour is 9.75*5.30 = £50.70





So, her overtime pay is £50.70.

Piecework

In some industries employees are paid for each item they produce - this is piecework. Sometimes piecework is paid as a 'bonus', in addition to a basic wage, for production over a specified level.

Example

Mary constructs toy dolls. She gets a basic wage of £130 for a five day week. She gets a 50p bonus for every doll over 80 she makes per day. The following is her daily production for one particular week - what was her gross pay that week?

Dolls Mary made from Monday to Friday: 100, 110, 80, 90, 90





The total number of dolls made over 80 = 20 + 30 + 0 + 10 + 10 = 70

Bonus pay = 70 * 50 = 3500 pence = £35 (divide pence by 100 to get pounds)

Total gross pay = basic wage + bonus = 130 +35 = £165





Commission

Salespeople, for example, are often paid a percentage of the value of the items they sell, sometimes in addition to a basic wage.

Example

Stewart sells double glazing. He does not get a basic wage, but gets 12.5% of the value of the windows he sells. One week he makes sales of the value of £1200, £800, £600, £1400, £1000. What is his commission for that week?





Total value of sales = 1200 + 800 + 600 + 1400 + 1000 = £5000

Commission (Stewart's pay) = 12.5% of 5000





Recall that



12.5% means = 12.5/100 = 0.125

and 'of' means 'multiply'





So, Stewart's commission = 0.125 * 5000 = £625

Salaries

People such as teachers and civil servants are paid a certain amount for a year's work, called their annual salary. This is usually divided into 12 equal monthly payments.

Example

A civil servant's gross pay is £1600 per month. What is his gross annual salary?

gross annual salary = pay per month * 12 = 1600 * 12 = £19200





* * *





TAX - start of this chapter - contents The Chancellor of the Exchequer raises money for government spending by taxation - this includes:





Direct taxation - Income tax, i.e. tax on a person's income

Indirect taxation - VAT ('Value Added Tax'), which is an amount added to most goods and services that we buy





PAYE ('Pay As You Earn')

This is the form of tax most people pay who are employed. The tax is deducted before they receive their pay.

Before working out the amount of tax to be paid, some tax allowances are taken from the gross income to find the taxable income .

Note: The tax rules can be changed each time there is a budget - so any figures stated below are not meant to be exact, but are just used for illustration.

Tax allowances include, for example:





a single person's allowance - E.g. £4500

a married couple's allowance - E.g. £3000

allowance for dependants





The married allowance is often added to the husband's personal allowance, but can be transferred to his wife.If we know a person's total tax allowances, then:





Taxable income = gross income - tax allowances





Tax on the taxable income is paid at different rates.



on the first £3000 of taxable income, tax is charged at 20 pence in the pound (i.e. 20%), and is the lowest rate of tax

on taxable income between £3000 and £25000, tax is charged at 25%, and is called the basic rate of tax

on taxable income above £25000, tax is charged at 40%, called the higher rate of tax





Once the tax is known, then:



net pay = gross pay - tax





Note that there are other deduction made as well as income tax, such as National Insurance. Example

John is married and has an annual salary of £20500. His wife isn't working. Using the figures quoted above for allowances and tax rates, calculate:



his tax allowance

his taxable income

the total tax he pays in the year

his net pay per month, ignoring any other deductions





1. Since John's wife is not working, he will get his personal allowance and the married couple allowance, so:



tax allowance = 4500 + 3000 = £7500





2. His taxable income is his gross salary less his tax allowance, so:



taxable income = 20500 - 7500 = £13000





3. John will pay:



tax at lowest rate, 20%, on the first £3000 of his taxable income



tax due = 20% of 3000 = 0.20 * 3000 = £600





tax at the basic rate, 25%, on the rest of his taxable income, i.e. on £10000 (=13000-3000), so



tax due = 25% of 10000 = 0.25 * 10000 = £2500





Total tax for the year = 600 + 2500 = £31004. John's net annual pay = gross pay - tax = 20500 - 3100 = 17400





Net pay per month = 17400/12 = £1450





VAT ('Value Added Tax')

VAT is added to many (but not all) goods and services.

Example

A computer is priced at £1000, excluding VAT.

What is the selling price with VAT at 17.5% added?





17.5% of 1000 = 0.175 * 1000 = 175

So, the selling price = £1000 + £175 = £1175





Recall that a quick way to add a percentage, such as the above is to:



change 17.5% to a decimal: 17.5% = 17.5/100= 0.175

add this to 1, which gives 1.175

multiply 1000 by this, to give 1000*1.175 = £1175





In the above example, notice that:

Remember that the '.175' in '1.175' comes from the VAT rate. If the rate were, for example:





12% we would use 1.12 (= 1 + 12/100 = 1 + 0.12)

8% we would use 1.08 (= 1 + 8/100 = 1 + 0.08) [not 1.8]

HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES - start of this chapter - contents Comparing prices

Example

Company A sells boxes containing 200 tea bags for £2-50.

Company B sells boxes of 250 tea bags for £3-00. If the only consideration is the price, which of these is better value?





One way of looking at this is to work out the cost per tea bag:





Company A charges £2-50 (=250p) for 200 bag: cost per tea bag = 250/200 = 1.25 pence

Company B charges £3-00 (=300p) for 250 bag: cost per tea bag = 300/250 = 1.20 penceThus, company B's tea bags are a little cheaper.





Another way of looking at this is to work out how many tea bags are obtained for one pound:





Company A: tea bags per pound = 200/2.50 = 80

Company B: tea bags per pound = 250/3.00 = 83.3Obviously, you will not get '.3' of a tea bag, but the calculation shows that you do get a few more per pound from company B.



Electricity

Most people pay for their electricity 'quarterly', i.e. they get a bill every three months.

An electricity bill is made up of three parts:



a fixed charge (called a 'standing charge') - this is charged even if no electricity is used

a charge for each 'unit' of electricity used [the unit is called a kilowatt hour ('kWh')]

VAT added to the total of parts (1) and (2)





Example (the figures used here are not meant to be exact, but just for the example)In the previous quarter, Carol used 1200 units of electricity. Her electricity company charges:





a standing charge of £13, and

8.5 pence per unit of electricity used





VAT is charged at 5%.How much is her electricity bill?





standing charge = £13

cost of units = 1200*8.5 pence = 10200 pence = £102.00 (divide pence by 100 to get £)

total of above = 13 + 102 = £115





To add VAT of 5%, we can:Either:





work out 5% of £115 and add it to the bill:



(5/100) * 115 = £5.75

total electricity bill, including VAT = 115 + 5.75 = £120.75





Or (slightly quicker):



multiply £115 by 1.05 (= 1 + 5/100 = 1 + 0.05)



total electricity bill, including VAT = 115.00 * 1.05 = £120.75





Gas

Gas bills are calculated in a similar manner to electricity bills, except:





the 'unit' is a quantity of gas, called a 'therm' (105 therms is about 100 cubic feet)

the standing charge for gas may soon be scrapped (so if no gas is used, there is no charge)





Mortgages

Most people obtain a mortgage to buy their house from a building society or a bank.

The maximum amount they will lend is typically 90% or 95% of the value of the house. The difference has to be paid by the buyer as a 'deposit'.

Example

John and Sue would like to buy a house valued at £55000. Their bank will lend a maximum of 95% of the house value. What is the maximum the bank will lend them, and how much deposit will they need?





The maximum the bank will lend = 95% of £55000 = (95/100) * 55000 = 0.95 * 55000 = £52250

The deposit = 55000 - 52250 = £2750





The maximum amount a mortgage lender will lend also depends on the income of the buyer(s). They will typically lend:



either 3 times the gross annual income of one person

or 2.5 times the joint gross income of a couple





Example John's gross annual income is £16000. Sue works part-time and earns £8000 a year. Their bank will lend them a maximum of 2.5 times their joint gross income. Can they buy the house in the last example?





Joint gross income = 16000 + 8000 = 24000

Maximum loan = 2.5 * 24000 = 60000





This is more than the £52250 they need for the house.

The amount borrowed to buy a house is called the capital . The total repaid includes interest, and is much more than the capital. A mortgage is usually paid back monthly over a term of 20 or 25 years. There are two types of mortgage repayments:





A repayment mortgage - each month a single payment is made, consisting of:



interest charged on the capital for the month, and

a part repayment of the capital





An endowment mortgage - each month two payments are made:



one is interest charged on the capital for the month

the other is a payment on an insurance policy - the policy is designed to 'mature' at the end of the mortgage term, and its value should pay off the capital





Example John and Sue take out a 25 year repayment mortgage for £52250 to buy the house mentioned previously.

At the moment, their bank charges £9.20 per month for each £1000 owed on a repayment mortgage taken over 25 years.

How much is their monthly repayment?





monthly repayment = (52250/1000) * 9.2 = 52.25 * 9.2 = £480.70





Insurance

Insurance is paid to avoid financial hardship arising in certain circumstances.

It is a legal requirement to have insurance before a car can be driven on public roads. The cover provided depends on the type of policy:





third party - this is the minimum insurance required by law - it covers injury to others and/or damage caused by your vehicle

third party fire and theft - in addition to the above, this provides some cover for your vehicle

comprehensive - in addition to the above this provides complete cover for your car





Most people, either as part of the monthly payment to their mortgage lender, or to a separate company, pay insurance for one or more of:



their life - if one partner dies, the whole mortgage can be paid off by the insurance company

their health/work - in the event of prolonged illness or injury or unemployment, the monthly payments may be paid by the insurance company (but often only for 1 year maximum)

damage to the house (e.g. fire)

damage to or theft of content





Example (the premium charges below are not exact, but are just for the purposes of the calculation)Gordon insures his house for £80000 and the contents for £20000.

His insurance company charges annual premiums of:





20 p for each £100 buildings cover

90 p for each £100 of contents cover





How much is his total annual premium?



buildings cover costs (80000/100) * 20 = 800 * 20 = 16000 p = £160 (divide pence by 100 to get £)

contents cover costs (20000/100) * 90 = 200 * 90 = 18000 p = £180

total annual premium = 160 + 180 = £340

Chapter 6



CREDIT

SAVINGS - COMPOUND INTEREST

TRAVEL





* * *





CREDIT - contents Hire purchase

When goods are bought on hire purchase, a deposit is usually paid, and the balance paid over a period of time. The seller usually adds interest to the balance. If an item is bought on hire purchase, the customer does not own the item until all the repayments have been made - if repayments are not made, the item can be repossessed (in effect, the item is on hire until it has been completely purchased ).

Example

A man buys a video. It has a cash price of £300. He pays a 25% deposit. Interest of 16% per annum (=per year) is added to the balance. Repayments are made in equal monthly instalments over twelve months. How much are the instalments?





Flat rate and APR

The interest quoted in the last example is called a flat rate of interest. The interest of £36 is equivalent to £3 per month. If the whole amount were repaid at the end of the year, the flat rate would be the true annual rate. However, repayments start after only a month, and so the balance is gradually reduced - so the interest paid is a progressively bigger part of the remaining balance.

The true interest rate, called the annual percentage rate (APR) is actually about double the flat rate:





Thus, the 16% flat rate in the last example is an APR of about 32%.Companies are legally obliged to quote interest as APR, so customers can compare the cost of credit.



Bank loans

If you borrow money from a bank or building society you will be charged interest, i.e. they will add a charge to the amount you borrow, which has to be paid in addition to the original amount.

The amount borrowed is called the principal .

Simple interest is a percentage of principal.

Example

A man borrows £500 at a simple interest rate of 15%. How much interest does he pay?

15% of 500 = 75

So, he pays £75 in interest. His total repayment is £500 +£75 , which is £575.

When simple interest is added to a loan taken over several years, the interest is calculated on the same original principal amount, so the interest per year is the same, so:





the total interest = the interest for the first year * the number of years





Example What is the simple interest on £500 borrowed for 4 years at 15%.

15% of 500 = 75

So, the interest per year is £75.

This £75 is charged for each year of the loan, so the total interest is 4*75 = £300



Overdrafts

An overdraft is an arrangement with a bank that allows a customer to draw money beyond the amount in the account. When an account is overdrawn, it can be thought of as a negative balance - money needs to be added to it to bring it back to a positive balance.

For example, Bob has £50 in his account and draws £200. He is now overdrawn by £150. He would need to add £150 to the account to bring it back to zero balance.

Overdrafts are often used as short-term arrangements. They can be an expensive way of borrowing money. Most banks charge a fixed amount per month when an overdraft is used, plus interest on the amount overdrawn. So Bob would actually have to pay back more than just the £150 he has overdrawn by.



Credit cards

A credit card allows a customer to spend up to a certain limit using the card. Credit cards can be used as readily as cash with many companies. They can also be used where cash cannot - such as for purchases made over the telephone, and now, more and more, over the Internet.

A credit card holder gets a statement each month showing (at least) the:





transactions made during the previous month

interest added

current balance

payment due





The interest added is typically about 2% per month (about 27% APR) and the monthly payment is typically 5% of the current balance.



* * *





SAVINGS - COMPOUND INTEREST - start of this chapter - contents Compound interest is the type that you would expect to get from a bank on your savings.

Suppose that a bank pays 7% interest on Jan 1st each year on the current balance in savings accounts.

Suppose that you place £500 in a savings account on Jan 1st 2000.





On Jan 1st 2001, you will get 7% of the £500 added as interest, which is £35, so your balance becomes £535

On Jan 1st 2002, the bank adds 7% of the new balance to you account. This is 7% of £535, which is £37.45. Thus, you get interest on the previous year's interest, and this is called compound interest





The following represents what happens to your initial £500 over a few years, if you make no withdrawals:



As an alternate method, we could add the 7% by multiplying by 1.07 (= 1 + 7/100 = 1 + 0.07):Initial balance = £500:





balance after year 1 = 500 * 1.07 = £535.00

balance after year 2 = 535.00 * 1.07 = £572.45

balance after year 3 = 572.45 * 1.07 = £612.52 (rounded to nearest whole pence)





* * *





TRAVEL - start of this chapter - contents Foreign currency

Example

Jim is going on holiday to Spain. His travel agent buys pesetas ('pts') at a rate or 240 pts per £ (pound sterling) and sells pesetas at a rate of 220 pts per £





Jim buys £150 worth of pesetas for his trip - how many pesetas does he get?

He returns with 8400pts. How much does he get back in pounds?





1. For £200 = gets 150 * 220 = 33000 pts

2. For 8400 pts he gets 8400/240 = £35

Time

A day is 24 hours long, and the time of day can be indicated in two ways:

On the 12-hour clock , the day is divided in two halves:





from midnight to midday (noon) - this is am

from midday to midnight - this is pm





On the 24-hour clock , the day is a single 24 hour interval. The time is indicated by 4 digits.If the time is 1.00pm or later, 12 hours is added to the 12-hour clock time to get the 24-hour clock time:





It is useful to understand the 24-hour clock - if only to correctly understand timetables, which are always written using it.

Chapter 7



USING SYMBOLS

SIMPLIFYING ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS

FACTORISING ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS





* * *





USING SYMBOLS - contents Peter is 5 years older than his sister Sue. If Sue is 8, how old is Peter? As an equation we could say that:





Peter's age = Sue's age + 5, so

Peter's age = 8 + 5 = 13 years





In algebra, we use letters (symbols) to stand for numbers. This allows us to change a problem expressed in words into a problem expressed in symbols.In the above case suppose that:





we let S stand for Sue's age and P stand for Peter's age, then

the information that Peter is five years older than Sue can be expressed as: P = S + 5

and being told that Sue is 8, we get Peter's age from P = 8 + 5 = 13 years





Now, suppose that the age of Peter and Sue's father is Sue's age plus twice Peter's age - how old is their father?If we let F stand for the age of their father, then we get the equation:





F = S + 2P, or we could just as well write this as: F = 2P + S





Note that:



2P and S are called terms in the algebraic expression 2P + S

in the expression 2P, the number 2 is called the coefficient of P

2P stands for 2*P [again remember that * means 'multiply' in these notes - by hand, we would write a cross (x)]





The process of replacing symbols by particular values is called substitution - for the above equation we get:



F = 2P + S = 2*13 + 8 = 26 + 8 = 34 years





Notice that we have to put the multiplication symbol back it when a letter is substituted by a number. If we simply put 13 in place of P in the expressions 2P, we would get 213, which is not the same a 2*13.We can obtain another expression for the right-hand side:





we have F = 2P + S, but

we also have P = S + 5, so

F = 2(S+5) + S





We can simplify the expression on the right (which just means making it as simple as possible) by:



removing the bracket by multiplying every term inside the bracket by the 2 outside:



F = 2(S+5) + S = 2*S + 2*5 + S = 2S + 10 + S





collecting together like terms - which means the 2S and S above, so we get: F = 3S +10





Substituting the value of S, i.e. Sue's age into this should give us the same value of F, her father's age, as before:



F = 3S +10 = 3*8 + 10 = 24 + 10 = 34 (same as before)





Sometimes a problem may be expressed in words and we have to choose what letters to stand for what quantities, as in the above case. Sometimes, we may have an equation in which the meanings of the symbols are not specified.For example, if y = 2x + 3, what is y when x = 5?

We do not need to know what x or y stand for in order to perform the substitution:





y = 2x + 3 = 2*5 + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13





* * *





SIMPLIFYING ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS - start of this chapter - contents Suppose that y = 3x + 2x. We can simplify this by writing it as y = 5x. Nothing has changed - we've merely expressed the algebraic expression on the right in a simpler form.

Notice that if we choose a value for x, say x = 2, then





the original expression 3x + 2x = 3*2 + 2* 2 = 6 + 4 = 10

the final expression 5x = 5*2 = 10





This same sort of check can be used no matter how many letters occur in an expression that you are simplifying. Just give the letters values and work out the value of original and final expression. If they are not the same, then you've made a mistake somewhere, and you need to check your working. (this is not an absolute check since, sometimes the answers may be the same even though a mistake has been made - but it is till a worthwhile check).To simplify algebraic expressions, it is necessary to know the rules that can be applied to them.



Rules for addition and subtraction

The rules that apply to numbers also apply to the letters in algebra:





If there is no sign put in front of a number then it is positive. E.g. 2 is the same as +2 and a is the same as +a

When two minus signs occur together, change them into a plus. E.g. 3 - (-4) = 3 + 4, and a - (-b) = a + b





We can only add or subtract like terms, i.e. those with the same algebraic quantity following their coefficient, and what we actually do is add or subtract the coefficients of the terms. Examples

3x + 5x - 2x = (3 + 5 - 2)x = 6x

4x - x = 4x -1x = (4 - 1)x = 3x

4w2 + 5w2 = 9w2

3y2 + 3x + 4y2 - x = 3y2 + 4y2 + 3x - x = (3 + 4)y2 + (3 - 1)x = 7y2 + 2x



Rules for multiplication and division

When two numbers or letters are multiplied or divided then:





the answer is positive if they both have the same sign (both + or both -)

the answer is negative if they have opposite signs (one is + and the other is -)





Again, remember that if a number or a letter is not written with a sign, then it is taken as being positive:



a * b = (+a) * (+b) = +ab = ab

(-a) * (-b) = +ab = ab

a * (-b) = (+a) * (-b) = -ab

(-a) * b = (-a) * (+b) = -ab

a/(-b) = -a/b

(-a)/b = -a/b

(+a)/(+b) = +a/b = a/b

(-a)/(-b) = +a/b = a/b





If there are several items to multiply or divide, you can deal with them two at a time - for example:



a * (-b) * (-c) = (-ab) * (-c) = + abc = abc





Examples



Rules for indices

We may write 3*3*3*3*3 as 35 .

We say this a '3 to the power 5' or '3 raised to the power 5'. The number 3 is called the base , and the number 5 the index or the power .

Number with the same base can be combined in accordance with certain rules:



Examples





Removing brackets

When dealing with just numbers , we can reduce a bracket to a single number and then multiply or divide by whatever is outside the bracket, for example:





3*(4 + 5) = 3*9 = 27





However, in algebra, the terms in a bracket may be different. In this case, when we remove a bracket, we multiply or divide each term inside the bracket by what is outside:



3x(4x + y) = 3x*4x + 3x*y = 12x2 +3xy





If there is a minus sign outside a bracket, this is the same as -1, so we multiply each term inside the bracket by -1:



-(2x + 3y) = -1*(2x +3y) = -2x -3y

-(2x - 4z) = -1*(2x - 4z) = -2x + 4z [-1*(-4z) = + 4z]





If an expression contains more than one bracket, we remove the brackets first and then simplify if possible:-2(x-5y) + 5x(1+y) = -2x +10y +5x +5xy = 3x + 10y + 5xy



Multiplying two brackets

Consider: (2x + 1)(x - 3)

When removing these brackets each term in the first bracket must multiply each term in the second bracket:



Check : As a check, put any value of x in the original and the final expressions - suppose that we use x = 1:





(2x + 1)(x - 3) = (2*1 +1)(1-3) = 3 * (-2) = -6

2x2 - 5x - 3 = 2*12 - 5*1 -3 = 2 -5 -3 = 2 - 8 = -6





Both give the same result - as they should for any x value.



* * *





FACTORISING ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS - start of this chapter - contents The factors of a number are those numbers which divide exactly into it. For example:





the factors of 6 are: 1, 2, 3 and 6

the factors of 15 are: 1, 3, 5 and 15





If we 'factorise' a number, we express it in terms of (some of) its factors. For example:



6 = 2*3

15 = 3*5





The highest common factor (HCF) of two numbers is the highest number which will divide into both of them. For example:



the HCF of 6 and 15 is 3





Now consider the expression: 4x3 + 2x2 To factorise this we need to find the HCF of both terms. To find the HCF:





find the highest number which divides each coefficient - this is 2 in the above case

find the lowest power of each letter that the terms have in common - in the above case, the terms only have x in common, and the lowest power is x2

multiply the above together to get the HCF - so, the HCF =2*x2 = 2x2





We can now divide both terms by 2x2 , and place 2x2 outside a bracket:

Thus, the expression has been factorised, into the factors 2x2 and (2x + 1).

To check that the result is correct, we can 'multiply out' the expression, i.e. remove the brackets:





2x2 (2x + 1) = 2x2 *2x + 2x2 *1 = 4x3 + 2x2 (the original expression)



Example Factorise: 12x3 y+ 3x2 y2 .

Using the same procedure as before to find the HCF:





the highest number which divides each coefficient is 3

the terms have x and y in common, and the lowest power of each are x2 and y (= y1 )

so, the HCF of the terms = 3*x2 *y = 3x2 y





Dividing both terms by 3x2 y, and placing 3x2 y outside a bracket, gives:



12x3 y+ 3x2 y2 = 3x2 y(4x + y)





To check that the result is correct, remove the bracket:



3x2 y(4x + y) = 3x2 y*4x + 3x2 y*y = 12x3 y + 3x2 y2 (the original expression)





Example Factorise: ax + bx + ay + by

In this case we can group the terms:

ax + bx + ay + by = (a + b)x + (a + b)y = (a + b)(x + y)



Factorising the difference between two perfect squares

Perfect squares are quantities like 22 (= 4) and 32 (= 9) etc.

Expressions like a2 and b2 are also perfect squares.

Now, observe that (a + b)(a - b) = a2 - ba + ba - b2 = a2 - b2 . Thus,





a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)





The difference between two perfect squares can always be factorised in this way. It can be useful to look for the difference between two perfect squares in an expression since, when factorised as above, the expression may simplify. Example



Notice that we treat the quantity (a + b) as if it were a single term when we cancel it - we could not cancel just the a or just the b.

Check - Let a = 3 and b = 2:





original expression: (a2 - b2 )/(a + b) = (32 - 22 )/(3 + 2) = (9 - 4)/5 = 5/5 = 1

final expression: a - b = 3 - 2 = 1





The answers agree, as they should. Example





Factorising a quadratic expression





A quadratic expression is one in which the highest power of a variable is 2





Consider: (2x + 1)(x + 3) = 2x2 + 6x + x + 3 = 2x2 + 7x + 3The result that we get, 2x2 + 7x + 3, is a quadratic expression.

To factorise a quadratic expression, we need to do the opposite of the above, i.e. we start with a quadratic like 2x2 + 7x + 3 and turn it into a product of its factors such as (2x + 1)(x + 3). So, in general we want to:



If we consider how the expression 2x2 + 7x + 3 came from (2x + 1)(x + 3), this gives us an idea of how to reverse the process.

In the expression 2x2 + 7x + 3, the first term, 2x2 , comes from the product of two factors and the last term, +3, comes from the product of another two factors. So we list the possible factors for each of them:





Now we try each possibility, and see which one gives the correct middle term, +7x:

Hence, 2x2 + 7x + 3 = (2x + 1)(x + 3)

All the possibilities have been included above, for completeness, but it is not necessary to continue beyond the correct answer.

ALGEBRAIC FRACTIONS - contents These are fractions which contain algebraic quantities, rather than just numbers

Simplifying algebraic fractions sometimes means factorising the numerator and/or the denominator. The last two examples both required algebraic fractions to be simplified by factorising the numerator.



Multiplication and division





To multiply two numerical fractions we can multiply the numerators together and the denominators together and then see if we can simplify the result





For example,

We may prefer, if possible, to do some simplifying before multiplying the numerators and denominators:





When multiplying two algebraic fractions, the process is the same:





To divide by a numerical fraction, we can invert the fraction and then multiply by it





For example,





We can do the same with algebraic fractions, for example:





We could have done some partial cancellation before multiplying, but the final result would have been the same.



Addition and subtraction

To add or subtract two fractions we:





find the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators (the bottom parts), then

make all the denominators equal to the LCM , changing each numerator, as required, to keep each fraction the same, then

add or subtract the numerators, then simplify if possible





The LCM of algebraic quantities can often be found quite easily 'by inspection', i.e. just by comparing them.For example, what is the LCM of: 2x2 y2 , 3x3 y z and x y z4

To find the LCM of all the expressions we multiply the LCM of the coefficients by the highest power of each letter :





the LCM of 2 and 3 is 6

the highest power of x is x3

the highest power of y is y2

the highest power of z is z4





So, the LCM of 2x2 y2 , 3x3 y z and x y z4 = 6 x3 y2 z4 Example

EQUATIONS - start of this chapter - contents An equation states that two quantities, the left-hand side and the right-hand side, are equal.





3*4 + 1 = 13 is an arithmetic equation

2y = 4 is an algebraic equation

4y +7 = 3x -1 is an algebraic equation





An equation can be compared to a pair of balanced scales:



Suppose that the above scales are balanced with 4 grams on each side. The scales will remain balanced if we do the same to both sides. They remain balanced:



if we add the same to each side - for example, add 3 grams to both

if we subtract the same from both sides - for example remove 2 grams from both

if we multiply both sides by the same - for example, treble both to make them 12 grams

if we divide both sides by the same - for example, halve both to make them 2 grams





In algebraic equations we usually have one or more unknown quantities.



solving an equation means finding values of the unknown quantities which make the equation true





Since both sides of an equation are equal, they will remain equal if we do the same to each side - just like the above scales. So, both sides of an equation will remain equal:



if we add the same to both sides

if we subtract the same from both sides

if we multiply both sides by the same

if we divide both sides by the same





We can use the above operations to solve many equations, i.e. to find the values of unknown quantities. This is illustrated below.

Linear equations





In a linear equation, the highest power of a variable is 1





For example, y = 2x +1 and 3x - 4 = 7x are linear equations. (Remember that x is the same as x1 ) Example - requiring addition to both sides

Solve x - 3 = 4

At the moment, the 3 is subtracted from x, so to remove it we do the opposite - we add 3 to both sides:



Shortcut - you can go from the 1st to the 3rd line simply by taking the -3 across the equals sign and changing its sign to +3.

Check : When we have a solution, it can be substituted back into the original equation as a check:





x - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4, which is correct





Example - requiring subtraction from both sidesSolve x + 5 = 2

At the moment, the 5 is added to x, so to remove it we do the opposite - we subtract 5 from both sides:



Shortcut - you can go from the 1st to the 3rd line simply by taking the +5 across the equals sign and changing its sign to -5.





Check : x + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7, which is correct





Example - requiring multiplication of both sides

At the moment, x is divided by 3, so to remove it we do the opposite - we multiply both sides by 3:



Shortcut - you can go from the 1st to the 3rd line simply by moving the 3 from the bottom on the left to the top on the right.





Check: x/3 = 6/3 = 2, which is correct





Example - requiring division of both sidesSolve 4x = 8

At the moment, x is multiplied by 4, so to remove it we do the opposite - we divide both sides by 4:



Shortcut - you can go from the 1st to the 3rd line simply by moving the 4 from the top on the left to the bottom on the right





Check : 4x = 4*2 = 8, which is correct





Example Solve 2x - 4 = 2

The following shows every step:



We now repeat the process, but make use of a couple of the shortcuts mentions earlier - it makes the process simpler:





Check : 2x - 4 = 2*3 - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2, which is correct





* * *





SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS - start of this chapter - contents Consider:

3x + 2y = 7

x + y = 4

If we want values for the variables x and y which satisfy both equations, we call these simultaneous solutions and the equations are called simultaneous equations .The solutions will look like x = something, and y = something. Hence, we need to get x by itself and then y by itself (or the other way round).

We can use a procedure called an elimination method :



Now that we have x, we can substitute into one of the previous equations to find y:



Check : The values obtained, x = -1 and y = 5, are supposed to satisfy both the original equations, so we substitute them into both to check that they do:





(1) 3x + 2y = 3*(-1) + 2*5 = -3 + 10 = 7 (correct)

(2) x + y = -1 + 5 = 5 - 1 = 4 (correct)





* * *





FORMULAE (plural of 'formula') - start of this chapter - contents



A formula is an equation which represents the relationship between particular quantities





For example, the area A of a circle of radius r, is given by:

Sometimes it is necessary to transpose a formula to makes a particular letter into the subject, i.e. to get the letter by itself on the left-hand side of the equation.

Example



Put A = 78.54cm2 , and show that r = 5.0cm (as in the last calculation).

QUADRATIC EQUATIONS - contents



A polynomial equation contains powers of a variable. For example:





2x + 1 = 3, 2x2 + 7x = 4, 2x4 + 7x = 20





A quadratic equation is one in which the highest power of the variable is 2. For example:





2x2 + 7x + 3 = 0





In general we can represent a quadratic equation by the standard form :



ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b and c are numbers (in the above example, a = 2, b = 7 and c = 3)





Other quadratic equations can be rearranged to look like this:



Suppose that 2x2 + 7x + 3 = 2

We could rearrange this as 2x2 + 7x + 3 - 2 = 0, or 2x2 + 7x + 1 = 0, so it now looks like the general equation above, with a zero on the right





We can always make the coefficient 'a', of x2 , positive. For example:



Suppose that -3x2 + x - 2 = 0

If we multiply both sides (every term) by -1, then we get: +3x2 - x + 2 = 0. The right hand side stays zero, since anything multiplied by zero equals zero





Solving a quadratic by factorising

Recall that to solve an equation means finding the value(s) of the unknown quantity which make the equation true.

If we had the quadratic equation: x2 = 4, then:





one solution is x = 2, since 22 = 4

but another solution is x = -2, since (-2)2 = 4





It is generally the case that we expect two solutions to a quadratic equation.From previous notes, we know that (some) quadratics can be expressed as a product of two brackets.

Suppose that x2 + x - 2 = 0

We can factorise the expression on the left using the method already described to get:





x2 + x - 2 = (x + 2)(x - 1)





So, (x + 2)(x - 1) = 0.Now, since anything multiplied by zero equals zero, then either (x + 2) = 0 or (x - 1) = 0.





If x + 2 = 0, then x = - 2

If x - 1 = 0, then x = +1





So, the solutions of x2 + x - 2 = 0, are x = -2 and x = 1. Check : Remember that the solutions of x2 + x - 2 = 0 are those values of x that make the equation true. So we put each value into the equation as a check:





Using x = -2: x2 + x - 2 = (-2)2 - 2 - 2 = 4 - 4 = 0

Using x = 1: x2 + x - 2 = 12 + 1 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0





So, a procedure for solving quadratic equations is to: factorise the equations into the product of two brackets

set each bracket in turn equal to zero, and rearrange to get x for each - these are the solutions

put the x values back into the original quadratic expression, to check that it equals zero





Solving a quadratic by formula

The standard form of writing a quadratic equation is:





ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b and c are numbers





We can show that the solution of this type of equation can be found using the formula:



Let' s apply this to the equation already solved: x2 + x - 2 = 0Here a = 1, b = 1, c = -2:

So,

FINDING A SOLUTION BY TRIAL AND IMPROVEMENT - start of this chapter - contents If x3 = 20, what is the value of x, to 2 decimal places?

The idea of the trial and improvement method is to gradually get nearer and nearer to the correct solution. This is illustrated below for the above problem. We start with a low value of x and gradually increase it:

If x = 1, then x3 = 1

If x = 2, then x3 = 8

If x = 3, then x3 = 27

We want to find the x value for x3 = 20. Now, 20 is between 8 and 27.

So, the value of x for which x3 = 20 must be between x = 2 and x = 3.

Let's try x = 2.5, which is between 2 and 3: If x = 2.5, then x3 = 15.625

So, the value of x for which x3 = 20 must be between x = 2.5 and x = 3

Let's try x = 2.7: If x = 2.7, then x3 = 19.683

So, the value of x for which x3 = 20 must be between x = 2.7 and x = 3

Let's try x = 2.8: If x = 2.8, then x3 = 21.952

So, the value of x for which x3 = 20 must be between x = 2.7 and x = 2.8

Let's try x = 2.71: If x = 2.71, then x3 = 19.903

So, the value of x for which x3 = 20 must be between x = 2.71 and x = 2.8

Let's try x = 2.72: If x = 2.72, then x3 = 20.124

So, the value of x for which x3 = 20 must be between x = 2.71 and x = 2.72

We see that the value of x3 is nearer to 20 using x = 2.71 than when using x = 2.72, so the solution of x3 = 20 to 2 decimal places is x = 2.71.

The method looks a lot simpler if we put the values in a table:



Note - the above type of procedure is also called an iterative method of finding a solution.The answer in the above case could be found directly by using your calculator:





If x3 = 20, then x = 201/3 (= 2.714)





However, the method is valuable because it can be applied to problems which cannot be solved so directly.

INEQUALITIES - start of this chapter - contents The following represents the number line - it extends forever in both directions. Any number lies somewhere on this line. If we pick one particular number, such as 2, then any number is either equal to 2 or is less than 2 or is greater than 2.



This introduces the idea of inequalities , which requires some new symbols:



An inequality that contains an unknown variable, can be solved using the same rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division as already used with equations, but with one extra rule:





if both sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by a negative number then the inequality sign must be reversed

The following flow chart describes the process of completing the table on the right:



The diamond shaped box is a decision box . The box asks a question and a 'YES' or 'NO' arrow is then followed, depending on the answer. In the above case, if x is greater than or equal to 5, then the YES is followed which leads to the process being stopped.

CARTESIAN COORDINATES - contents



A cartesian graph consists of a grid on which we draw two straight lines at right angles

These lines are called rectangular axes , one is called the x-axis and the other is the y-axis

The positive x-axis is to the right and the positive y-axis is upwards

The lines usually meet at the origin , where x = 0 and y = 0

By numbering the axes, such as indicated below, the location of any point can be specified by its x and y coordinates





A pair of coordinates is represented by, for example, (4,2). The first number is an x value, and the second is a y value:



the point (4, 2) is found by starting at the origin and moving 4 in the positive x direction (right), then 2 in the positive y direction (up)

the point (2, 3) is found by starting at the origin and moving 2 in the positive x direction (right), then 3 in the positive y direction (up)





Coordinates can also be negative, for example:



the point (3, -4) is found by starting at the origin and moving 3 in the positive x direction (right), then 4 in the negative y direction (down)

the point (-4, -3) is found by starting at the origin and moving 4 in the negative x direction (left), then 3 in the negative y direction (down)

the point (-3, 3) is found by starting at the origin and moving 3 in the negative x direction (left), then 3 in the positive y direction (up)

STRAIGHT LINE GRAPHS - start of this chapter - contents

Plotting a graph

If you are given an equation such as y - 2x -1 = 0 , and asked to plot (or draw) a graph of y against x, the first thing to do is to get y by itself on the left of the equal sign.

In the above case, we take the two terms, -2x and -1, to the right of the equal sign, changing the signs of both of them, and so we get the equation y = 2x + 1 . In this form we say that y is expressed as a function of x . The value we get for y depends on the value we put in the equation for x.

We now choose a range of values for x and work out the corresponding values for y:



Now let's plot a graph of y (vertical) against x (horizontal):



When you plot a graph:



chose the scales so that the graph is quite large - both axes should occupy at least half of the side of the page (if they do not, then you could have doubled the scale)

label both axes, including units, if there are any

make the individual points stand out, for example, by using crosses (x) - if you use small dots, they may disappear when you draw a line through them, which could cost marks, since an examiner will be looking to see if individual points have been plotted correctly

give the graph a title





Once a graph is drawn, it can be used to find y for any chosen value of x:



at the chosen x value, draw a vertical line, so that it meets the graph - this has been done at x = 3.5 on the above graph

draw a horizontal line until it meets the y-axis - in the above case it meets at y = 8





So, when x = 3.5, y = 8. In this case, you could have got the answer directly from the equation y = 2x +1, but you may be given a graph without knowing its equation, so you need to know how to read values from a graph.

Gradient

The above graph is a straight line. The incline of a graph is called its slope or gradient . We can work out the gradient from the graph by drawing a triangle on it as below:





The triangle can be drawn anywhere but, for accuracy, the bigger it is the better. We calculate the gradient as:



In the graph, the y axis is drawn through the point x = 0, and we see that he graph cuts (or intercepts) the y axis at y = 1.

The equation for the graph is y = 2x + 1, and notice that:

the gradient equals the number in front of the x, and

the intercept on the y axis is the number following the 2x





This pattern is always followed for straight line graphs. This leads to the general equation for a straight line :



Where m = gradient of the graph, and c = intercept on the y axis.The value of m, the gradient, can be positive, negative or zero:



Notice that to get the value of c directly from the equation y = mx + c, we put x = 0, then we have y = c.

Note: In the straight line equation, y = mx + c, If the value of c is changed, this changes the point at which the graph cuts the y axis, but it does not change its gradient (m). So:





straight line graphs with the same m values, but different c values, are parallel





For example, the following produce parallel lines when plotted:



y = 2x +1

y = 2x + 4

y = 2x + 10 etc.





Straight line graphs at right angles

Consider the functions y = 2x +1 and y = -0.5x +6. These both have the form y = mx +c, so will both produce straight line graphs. The first has a positive slope (+2), and the second has a negative slope (-0.5).

For y = 2x +1:



For y = -0.5x +6:



The two sets of points are now plotted on the same axes:





We can see by eye that the lines appear to be at right angles (90 o ) to each other. Notice that if we multiply their gradients, we get 2*(-0.5) = -1. This is a general rule:

If the product of the gradients of two straight line graphs equals -1, then the lines will be at right angles to each other when plotted on the same axes





Notice also, that plotting graphs for different functions of x on the same axes lets us find out where the graphs cross.The above graphs cross at x = 2 and y = 5. Putting x = 2 into the two functions of x, we have:





y = 2x +1 = 2*2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5

y = -0.5x + 6 = -0.5*2 + 6 = -1 + 6 = 5





* * *





PARABOLAS - start of this chapter - contents Lots of functions of x produce curved graphs, and a few are given special names.

Consider the quadratic equation y = 3x 2 . To plot the graph, we work out y for a few selected values of x:





From this we can plot the graph:



Note that if y = -3x 2 , then all the y values in the above table would be negative, so the above graph would be the opposite way up.Suppose that we change the original equation to y = 3x 2 + 4:



The effect of the +4 is to move the previous graph by 4 in the +y direction



To be general:



A quadratic equation is one which can be written like y = ax 2 + bx + c, where a, b and c are numbers, and a is not zero , and these produce graphs called parabolas (we specify that a is not zero because, if it were zero, then ax 2 would vanish and we would have a straight line equation y = bx + c)





Note: Given an equation, it often helps to rearrange it into the form y = ...... to help decide what shape graph it would produce. For example, if you are asked to plot or describe the shape of the graph for 3x 2 - y + 4 = 0, it may help to firstly rearrange it as y = 3x 2 + 4, then it can be seen to be like y = ax 2 + c, and so it will be a parabola.



* * *





CUBIC FUNCTIONS - start of this chapter - contents A cubic function of x is one in which the highest power of x is 3. The following are all cubic equations:





y = 4x 3 + x 2 - 2x

y = 3x 3 + 7x + 5

y = x 3





To be more general:





A cubic equation is one which can be written as y = ax 3 + bx 2 + cx + d, where a, b c and d are numbers and a is not zero, and these produce graphs similar to the above (we specify that a is not zero because, if it were zero, then ax 3 would vanish and we would have a quadratic equation y = bx 2 + cx + d)





* * *





RECTANGULAR HYPERBOLA - start of this chapter - contents



An equation which can be arranged to look like y = a/x, where a is a number, but not zero, produces a rectangular hyperbola





Again, you may need to rearrange an equation to get y alone to see if it looks like y = a/x.For example, suppose that xy = 4. This rearranges to y = 4/x. We can choose a set of x values, work out the corresponding y values, and then plot y against x to obtain the typical shape of a rectangular hyperbola.

Note that when working out values for the table, we cannot include x = 0. Try 4/0 on a calculator. You get an error message since anything divided by zero equals infinity.





Notice that the curves never meet or cut the axes. As x gets close to zero, the curves head towards infinity.Also, notice that the curves have two lines of symmetry (we return to the topic of symmetry latter):





* * *





EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS - start of this chapter - contents An exponential function of x has the form y = p qx (only q is raised to the power x, not p). In this equation:





p is a constant (i.e. its value does not change), and

q is a positive constant





Notice that if we put x = 0, then y = p, since q0 = 1 (since any number to the power zero equals 1)

So in a graph of y against x, when x = 0, the graph cuts the y axis at y = p:

Given a graph such as the above, we can find both p and q, as in the next example: Example

It is believed that the relationship between y and x is of the form: y = p qx , where p and q are constants.

Use the graph below to determine values for p and q.





Firstly, when x = 0, y = p = intercept on y axis = 3.0Now that we have p, we can choose any pair of values on the graph to determine q:

For x = 1.5, we see that y = 8.5, so:





8.5 = 3.0* q1.5

So, q1.5 = 8.5/3.0 = 2.83

So, q = (2.83)1/1.5 = 2.0



On the calculator, you would enter:



2.83

press yx (or equivalent)

press (

enter 1/1.5

press )

press =





You should get, q = 2.0So, the original equation can be expressed as: y = 3.0 * 2.0x

As a check:





when x = 0, y = 3 * 2.00 = 3 * 1 = 3

when x = 1.5, y = 3 * 2.01.5 = 3 * 2.83 = 8.5

SOLVING EQUATIONS USING GRAPHS - contents A quadratic equation

When we 'solve' and equation such as x 2 - 4 = 0, this means that we find the value(s) of x which make the equation true.

We can solve the above equation by isolating the x by itself on the left of the equal sign. Thus,





x 2 - 4 = 0, so

x 2 = 4 (taking the -4 across and changing its sign), so

x = + 2 or -2





We can also solve this (and more complex equations) by drawing a graph.



We let y = x 2 - 4. When y = 0, we get back the original equation, 0 = x 2 - 4, so

We plot a graph of y against x for a range of x values, and

The x values on the graph at which y = 0 are the solutions of the equation 0 = x 2 - 4





So, we first produce a table of x and y values:



Then we plot the graph, drawing a smooth curve through the points:





The points where the graph cuts the x axis are the x values at which y = 0. And since y = x 2 - 4, these values of x are the solution of the equation 0 = x 2 - 4. We see that these points are at x = 2 and x = -2.

A cubic equation

Suppose that we want the solution of: x 3 - 3x 2 - 4x + 5 = 0.

We can do this the same way:





We let y = x 3 - 3x 2 - 4x + 5. When y = 0, we get the original equation, so

We plot a graph of y against x for a range of x values, and

The x values on the graph at which y = 0 are the solutions of the equation 0 = x 3 - 3x 2 - 4x + 5





The graph is shown below, and we see that there are 3 solutions (labelled x1, x2 and x3):



Simultaneous equations

Suppose that we have two functions of x, y1 = 2x 2 - 6 and y2 = 2x +1 and we want to know which values of x make y1 equal to y2 , i.e. we want the simultaneous solutions of both equations.

Procedure:





Work out y1 and y2 for the same range of x values

Plot both graphs on the same axes

The points at which the graphs cross give the values of x which make y1 and y2 the same





Example Use the graph of y = x2 + 5x to solve x2 + 5x = 7.

Firstly we plot a graph of y = x2 + 5x. Then we draw a horizontal line at y = 7.



The solutions are where the graph and the horizontal line cross: at x = -6.14 and x =1.14 Example

Solve graphically the equation x3 = x2 + 5x.

Here we can plot graphs for:





y1 = x3 ,and

y2 = x2 + 5x





The x values at which the graphs cross are the solutions of x3 = x2 + 5x, since when they cross, y1 = y2 .

The graphs cross three times, giving the solutions x = -1.8, x = 0, and x = 2.8



* * *





EQUATIONS CHANGED TO LINEAR GRAPHICAL FORM - start of this chapter - contents We've seen that for an equation of the form y = m x + c, that:





a graph of y against x is a straight line

m = the slope (gradient) of the graph

c = intercept on y axis (where x = 0)





Now consider, for example, y = 3x2 + 10. If we plot y against x, we will get a curve (a parabola).

However, compare this equation with y = mx + c.





These equation have the same form: a variable = a constant * a variable + a constant . Further:



if we plot y against x2 (instead of x) we get a straight line of gradient 3 and intercept 10 on the y axis





This is the case for any equation that can be arranged to 'look' like y = m x + c. We can plot y against whatever corresponds to x to get a straight line graph. Example

It is believed that y and x are related by an equation of the form: y = a x2 + b. Use the following data to determine values for a and b:



If y = a x2 + b then a graph of y against x will be a curve.

However, if we compare y = a x2 + b with y = m x + c, then plotting y against x2 should produce a straight line graph of slope a , and intercept b on the y axis.

We need to add values of x2 to the above data:



We plot the graph, and draw a best fit straight line through the points:





In working out the slope, we can draw the triangle anywhere. However, it can help to choose it so that B is an easy number to divide by. In the above case B = 20, so we can calculate the slope mentally (even if you use a calculator to find the slope, it is still useful to be able to do a quick mental check on the answer).

Now we can write the original equation as:





y = 2.0 x2 + 5.0





As a check, choose a couple of x values from the data, and see if this equation gives good values for y:



x = 1, y = 2.0*12 + 5.0 = 2 + 5 = 7 (value in the table is 6.9)

x = 5, y = 2.0*52 + 5.0 = 5 + 5 = 55 (value in the table is the same)





* * *





TRANSFORMATION OF FUNCTIONS/GRAPHS - start of this chapter - contents An expression such as 2x2 + 1 is called a function of x.

We may write these as f(x) = 2x2 + 1 or often as y = 2x2 + 1.

Consider the function y = f(x) = x2 . This is a quadratic equation, and we've see previously that it produces a U-shaped graph, called a parabola:





Now, if y = f(x) = x2 has the above shape, what about:



y = f(x) + a = x2 + a, or

y = f(x + a) = (x + a)2 , or

y = f(kx) = (kx)2 , where a and k are constants





1. Consider:



y = f(x) = x2

y = f(x) + 10 = x2 + 10, and

y = f(x) - 10 = x2 - 10





Plotting all three on one pair of axes we can compare them:

We see that:





f(x) + 10 is 10 above f(x), and

f(x) - 10 is 10 below f(x)





2. Consider:



y = f(x) = x2

y = f(x + 2) = ( x + 2)2 , and

y = f(x - 2) = ( x - 2)2





We see that:



f(x + 2 ) is 2 to the left of f(x)

f(x - 2 ) is 2 to the right of f(x)





3. Consider:



y = f(x) = x2

y = f(2x) = (2x)2





Note that:





when x = 4, f(x) = 42 = 16

when x = 2, f(2x) = (2x)2 = (2*2)2 = 42 = 16





So, f(2x) = (2x)2 is half the width of f(x) = x2 .So, transforming f(x) in one of the above ways:





moves the graph of f(x) up or down, or

moves the graph of f(x) left or right, or

changes the width of the graph of f(x)

GRAPHS AND INEQUALITIES - start of this chapter - contents

The solution to this is all those values of x and y which make the inequality true.

The solution can be represented graphically. Firstly we draw the graph of the equation y = 2 - x, for a range of x values:





We now draw the line for y = 2 - x.



If we look at a point on the line, such as the * then:



at that point y = 2 - x = 2 - 4 = -2

every y value directly above the * satisfies the inequality y > 2 - x, i.e. y > -2

every y value directly below the * satisfies the inequality y < 2 - x, i.e. y < -2





So:



the line satisfies the equation y = 2 - x, and

the region below the line satisfies the inequality y < 2 - x

TRAVEL GRAPHS

TRAVEL GRAPHS - contents Speed and velocity



A unit of speed comes from whatever units of distance and time are used in the equation.

Example: If a car moves 100km in 2 hours, its average speed is 100km/2h = 50km/h.

Example: An athlete does the 100m sprint in 10s.

Average speed = distance/time = 100m/10s = 10m/s.

We say ‘average’ speed because the athlete starts from rest and accelerates, so his speed is changing as he runs – but he has an average speed over the 100m.





The standard units used in science are called SI units . The SI unit for speed is m/s, which we also write as ms -1





We often use the terms 'speed' and 'velocity' as if they are exactly the same. But, strictly speaking, they are not:



So, if an object is falling at 15m/s:





its speed is 15m/s

its velocity is 15m/s straight downwards





So, to specify a velocity, we should give a direction as well as speed. However, the distinction between speed and velocity is only actually important if the direction of motion is important.

Scalars and vectors

Physical quantities are classified into two groups:





A scalar quantity has size or magnitude only (i.e. just a number and a unit) - so speed is a scalar quantity

A vector quantity has size and direction - so velocity is a vector quantity





Distance-time graphs

a) Zero velocity





A horizontal line means that distance is unchanging, i.e. the object is at rest, i.e. the speed or velocity is zero.

b) Constant velocity





A straight, inclined line means that the object is moving with constant velocity. The slope (or gradient) of the line equals the velocity. To find the slope:





draw a triangle such as shown above

work out A and B from the axes (don't measure them in cm)

slope = A/B





In the above case: velocity = slope = 6m/3s = 2m/s

Velocity-time graphs (or v-t graphs)

There are two main quantities that can be found from a v-t graph:

1. Area below v-t graphs





The area below any section of a v-t graph equals the distance travelled in that section





2. Acceleration Ordinarily we say that a car is accelerating when it is getting faster. The more rapidly its speed/velocity increases, the greater its acceleration. This idea leads to the definition that:





acceleration is the rate of change of velocity





Any velocity unit divided by any time unit is a possible unit for acceleration, so we could have the unit 'miles per hour per second' or 'km/h per second' etc. However, the standard unit, i.e. the SI unit, is 'm/s per second'. This can be expressed as (m/s)/s or m/s 2 (said as 'metres per second squared').

A familiar acceleration is the acceleration produced by gravity. We know that if we drop something it usually falls towards the ground, getting faster as it falls. It is therefore accelerating towards the ground. Notice that since the acceleration has a direction, acceleration is a vector quantity .





Example





The above is a velocity-time graph for a certain object. It is made up of three sections: A, B, C.



determine the acceleration in each section

determine the distance travelled in each section and the total distance travelled

describe the motion of the object





1) For each section:





Section A:- acceleration = (10 – 0)/2 = 10/2 = 5 (m/s)/s = 5 m/s 2

Section B:- acceleration = (10 – 10)/4 = 0/4 = 0 (zero over any non-zero number is zero)

Section C:- acceleration = (0 – 10)/ 4 = –10/4 = – 2.5 m/s 2





Notice that the acceleration is positive when the object is speeding up, and negative when it is slowing down. 2)





Section A: distance = area of triangle = ½ base x height = ½ x 2 x 10 = 10 m

Section B: distance = area of rectangle = 4 x 10 = 40 m

Section C: distance = ½ base x height = ½ x 4 x 10 = 20m

Total distance = 10 + 40 + 20 = 70 m





3)



The object starts from rest

It accelerates for 2 sec at 5m/s 2 reaching 10 m/s, moving 10m

It continues at 10 m/s for 4 sec, moving a further 40m

Then it decelerates at a rate of 2.5 m/s 2 coming to rest in 4 sec, moving a further 20m.

It moves a total distance of 70m





Example When a parachutist jumps from an aeroplane s/he initially accelerates. However, the air resistance (called 'drag') acting on the parachutist increases with speed. Eventually a speed is reached at which the downward force of gravity is balanced by the drag of the air. The speed of the parachutist then stays constant at the so-called 'terminal velocity' (over 100 mph) - until the parachute is released.





We can set up something similar in the laboratory - by dropping a small ball bearing though a viscous (sticky) liquid. The following represents an experimental set-up, together with a graph of velocity against time for the falling ball bearing released from rest:

The acceleration of the ball bearing equals the gradient of the graph at any particular point.





Determine the acceleration of the ball bearing at time = 2 seconds.





At the point on the curve corresponding to time = 2 seconds we:



draw a tangent, and then

add sides to turn it into a triangle, and then

determine the gradient of the tangent - this equals the required acceleration





Trapezium rule

A trapezium is a quadrilateral (a 4-sided figure) with one pair of parallel sides, and:



The equation is the same, whether the trapezium is short and fat or tall and thin:





The trapezium rule uses one or more trapeziums to estimate the area below a curve





In the left-hand graph below, we want to find the area between the curve and the x-axis between x1 and x2 . By drawing lines from x1 and x2 to meet the graph, and then joining their tops, we produce a trapezium, as on the right:





The area of the trapezium = ½ * (y1 + y2 ) * h





The area of the trapezium is clearly less than the area below the curve, since a section above the trapezium is not included. However, we can improve the accuracy by using more trapeziums:





The area of the all three trapeziums = ½*(y1 + y2 )*h + ½*(y2 + y3 )*h + ½*(y3 + y4 )* h





We make the strips all the same width (h), since this lets us simplify the expression - firstly by taking h outside a bracket, since it occurs in every term:



area = [½*(y1 + y2 ) + ½*(y2 + y3 ) + ½*(y3 + y4 )]*h

= [½*y1 + ½*y2 + ½*y2 + ½*y3 + ½*y3 + ½*y4 ]*h



Simplifying further, we get:





This same pattern is followed for any number of trapezium strips used - and the more used, the closer the area calculated is to the true area below the curve. Example

The following is the v-t graph from earlier for a ball bearing falling from rest though a liquid:



Use the trapezium rule to estimate the distance fallen between 1 second and 4 seconds using three strips of equal widths.

In the following, the vertical sides labelled y1 etc. are actually velocities, so they could just as well be labelled v1 etc.:





Notice that the unit of area = unit of a vertical side * unit of a horizontal side = (cm/s)*s = cm = unit of distance.So, the distance travelled between 1 sec and 4 sec is approximately 15.5 cm.

ANGLES AND LINES

POLYGONS





* * *





ANGLES AND LINES - contents Angles

A line drawn across a circle, thought its centre, is called a diameter.

Two diameters, as below, divide a circle into 4 equals sections. If you draw this carefully on paper, and then cut out the 4 sections, they will fit exactly on top of each other.





The diameter lines are said to be at right angles or perpendicular to each other.



A right angle is defined as equal to ninety degrees (90o )





Angles that fall into certain categories have names:





Straight lines meeting or crossing





complementary angles are 2 angles which add together to make 90o





supplementary angles are 2 angles which add together to make 180o





Any number of angles that form a straight line add up to 180o





vertically opposite angles are formed when two straight lines cross, and:





Parallel lines

Parallel lines never meet:



In a figure, lines which are parallel are usually marked with the same number of arrows:





A line drawn across 2 or more parallel lines is called a transversal :





The transversal creates angles with the parallel lines, some of which obey definite rules:





Interior angles are on the same sides of the transversal, and are in between the parallel lines:





Alternate angles are on opposite sides of the transversal, and are in between the parallel lines:





Corresponding angles are on the same side of the transversal, and on the same sides of the parallel lines:





Example Find all the angles in the following, explaining your answers:





For straight lines meeting and/or crossing:



angles forming a straight line add to 180o

vertically opposite angles are equal





So,



a + 50o = 180o , as they are on a straight line, so a = 180 - 50 = 130o

d is vertically opposite b, so d = b = 50o

c is vertically opposite a, so c = a = 130o





For parallel lines:





alternate angles are equal

corresponding angles are equal





So,



d and f are alternate angles, so f = d = 50o

c and e are alternate angles, so e = c = 130o

d and h are corresponding angles, so h = d = 50o

c and g are corresponding angles, so g = c = 130o





The above is just one way of working out the answers.





* * *





POLYGONS - start of this chapter - contents A polygon is a plane (= flat) closed figure which has three or more straight sides.



A regular polygon is one in which the sides are all the same length and the interior angles are all the same. For example, a regular hexagon:





Triangles

These are the simplest polygons, each having 3 sides and 3 angles. They can be grouped into different types:





For the equilateral and isosceles triangle, if a line is drawn from the top vertex (corner), at right angles to the base, it bisects (cuts into two equal halves) the base and the vertex angle - the line is called a perpendicular bisector :





Sum of interior angles of a triangle

Though triangles vary in shape and size, they all have the shared property that:





The interior angles of any triangle add up to 180o





In the equilateral triangle, the interior angles must each be 60o (since 60o + 60o + 60o =180o ).

It is sometimes convenient to label any particular angle and the side opposite it with the same letter, one small and one large, as above.

Note - a perimeter is a boundary made up of lines, for example, the perimeter or edge of a garden may be rectangular:





The length of a perimeter made up of any number of lines equals the sum of the lengths of all the lines making up the perimeter (only 3 lines for a triangular perimeter, as indicated above)





Pythagoras' theorem

The following is a right-angled triangles with sides 3, 4 and 5 (these could all be cm, all inches or all anything else):





Note that:



the side opposite the right-angle is called the hypotenuse of the triangle - it is always the longest side (the side marked 5 in the above case)





Suppose now that we draw a square on each side, and work out their areas:



Notice that: 25 = 16 + 9, or 52 = 42 + 32 This relationship is found to be true for any right-angled triangle, not just one with sides 3, 4 and 5. It is called Pythagoras' theorem :





For any right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides





We can represent this in general as:





Quadrilaterals

These can be grouped into different types:





Sum of interior angles of a polygon

We've seen that in all triangles, the sum of the interior angles, A + B + C = 180o :



We can use the above fact to find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon, by dividing the polygon into a set of non-overlapping triangles. Notice that, in the following, the triangles have been formed by drawing diagonals from one vertex (this prevents the triangles from overlapping):



Notice that:





a quadrilateral has 4 sides and divides into 2 triangles , so the sum of its interior angles = 2*180o = 360o

a pentagon has 5 sides and divides into 3 triangles , so the sum of its interior angles = 3*180o = 540o

a hexagon has 6 sides and divides into 4 triangles , so the sum of its interior angles = 4*180o = 720o





This pattern is followed for polygons with any number of sides - a polygon with n sides can be divided into (n - 2) non-overlapping triangles, so:



the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides = (n - 2)*180o





Since equals 180o = 2*90o (= 2 right angles) the above is sometimes expressed as:



the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides = (2n - 4)*90o





Note: For a regular hexagon, each interior angle = 720o /6 = 120o . We can do a similar calculation for any regular polygon.

Sum of exterior angles of a polygon

The 'exterior angles' of a polygon are the ones outside it.

The exterior angles can be formed by extending each side of the polygon. In the following, starting at point X, the sides have been extended (or 'produced') in turn, going anticlockwise around the polygon:



The exterior angles are angle1, angle2, angle3, angle4 and angle5.

Notice that at every point, such as X, the exterior angle + the interior angle = 180o , since these angles are on a straight line.

Imagine that you are standing on X, facing A, and then you:





turn on the spot though angle1

then turn through angle2

then turn through angle3

then turn through angle4

finally turn through angle5





You have turned through a complete circle, 360o . This may be clearer if you look at the right hand diagram, where the angles have been joined together.This is the case, for a polygon of any number of sides, so:





The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon = 360o

CONGRUENCE AND SIMILARITY

GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTIONS





* * *





CONGRUENCE AND SIMILARITY - contents Congruence

Congruent shapes have the same shape and size.





Solids may be congruent - in a dinner service, some plates will be congruent and some dishes will be congruent, etc.

Figures drawn on paper may be congruent - if two shapes are cut out, and they can be fitted exactly on top of each other, then they are congruent





Figures are congruent if:



all corresponding angle are equal, and

all corresponding sides are equal





The following are congruent triangles:

The following are also congruent triangles:

To test for congruence between two figures you could:





cut them out and see if they fit exactly on top of each other, or

measure and label every side and angle on both figures, and see if they have corresponding sides and angles the same





Similarity

Figures are similar if:

all corresponding angle are equal, and

all corresponding sides are in the same ratio



(1) means that similar figures have the same shape, and (2) means that they may have different sizes.

[Figures which are identical (congruent) are similar, and the ratio of corresponding sides is 1:1]The following are similar figures - all the sides are in the ratio 1:2.





Similar triangles

As already said, two figures are similar if:

all corresponding angle are equal, and

all corresponding sides are in the same ratio



In the case of triangles, we do not need to measure all the angles and all the sides to see if two triangles are similar. Two triangles are similar if any one of the following is true: all three corresponding angles are equal, or

the ratios of corresponding sides are equal, or

the ratio of two corresponding sides are the same, and the angle between them are equal





Area and volumes

3D (3 dimensional) objects can also be similar. The following are similar - all the lengths are in a ratio of 1:3.





We see also that:



The area of a side of the large cube is 9 (= 32 ) times the area of the corresponding side of the small cube

The volume of the large cube is 27 (= 33 ) times the volume of the small cube





The number 3 is called the 'linear scale factor' - it is the amount by which we multiply each length to change the small cube into the large cube.In general, if two objects are similar, with a linear scale factor of S, then:





the area scale factor is S2

the volume scale factor is S3





* * *





SYMMETRY - start of this chapter - contents 1. Reflexive symmetry





A figure has reflexive symmetry if a line can be drawn through it, dividing it in two, and one half is the mirror image of the other half





Such a line is called a line of reflexive symmetry , or just a line of symmetry - some figures have more than one:



You can check a line of symmetry by placing the straight edge of a plane (= flat) mirror on the line and viewing the reflection.The following represents a regular hexagon and its six lines of symmetry:





2. Rotational symmetry

The following diamond shape has reflexive symmetry about AC and BD, as seen above.

Suppose now that it is rotated about its geometric centre, O, until it arrives back at its original position:



Since it looks the same in two positions, the shape is said to have rotational symmetry of order 2 about the point of rotational symmetry , O. (We only count the 1st and 3rd diagrams, since in the 5th the shape is back in its original position)



Triangles





We can use symmetry to work out some properties of various shapes:



Parallelograms

1. Parallelogram - opposite sides parallel

In the following, the letters A etc., are used to label the corners, but they also represent the interior angles at the corners. If we rotate the left-hand parallelogram about O though 180o it becomes the right-hand diagram. These diagrams are exactly the same, so the parallelogram has rotational symmetry about O. It only looks the same in these two positions when rotated, so we say that it has rotational symmetry of order 2.



These diagrams are exactly the same - and we see that:



AB is where DC was, so AB = DC (similarly AD = BC)

A is now where C was, which means that angle A = angle C (similarly angle B = angle D)

OA is where OC was so OA = OC (similarly OB = OD)





So, the rotational symmetry implies that:

2. Rhombus - a parallelogram with all sides equal length

Since a rhombus is a type of parallelogram, the above properties apply to it. But also:



3. Rectangle - a parallelogram with all angles right-angles



4. Square - a rectangle with all sides equal

Since a square is a type of rhombus, the above properties of a rhombus apply to it. But also, it has:





Kites

A kite has no parallel sides and has 2 pairs of adjacent side equal length - also:





* * *





CIRCLES - start of this chapter - contents Terminology





There are various rules that apply to circles, lines and angles - some of these are called 'theorems'.



Subtended angles

The phrase 'the angle subtended by an arc at a point' means the angle opposite to the arc, whose size is determined by the size of the arc:





Cyclic quadrilaterals

A cyclic quadrilateral is one with all its corners touching a circle





Right-angles in circles



In the left-hand diagram, the radius r is referred to as the 'perpendicular bisector of the chord'.

Tangents





Example

In the following, C is the centre of the circle. Work out the unknown angles.



a, c and d are angles in a triangle which has been drawn in a semicircle, so d is right angled triangle:



d = 90o

so, c = 90 - 70 = 20o





By the alternate segment theorem, g = c = 20o b and (e + d) are opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral, so:





b + d + e = 180o

so, 40 + 90 + e = 180o

so, e = 180 - 40 - 90 = 50o





Area of a circle

Many centuries ago it was discovered that if the circumference of any circle were divided by its diameter, the same number was always obtained, 3.142 (to 3 decimal places).



It can be shown that the area of a circle can be found from:





* * *





GEOMETRICAL CONSTRUCTIONS - start of this chapter - contents Triangles

A triangle has 3 sides and 3 angles, but you don't need to know all of them to draw one.

Example

Draw a triangle with sides 5cm, 6cm and 10cm.



To draw the above, the procedure was to:



draw a 5cm horizontal line, labelled AB

set a pair of compasses to 10cm, put the point on A, and draw an arc (any length, but not too short)

set the compasses to 6cm, place the point on B and draw another arc, to cross the first one

label the point where they cross as C, and draw the lines shown





The question does not say which way to draw the triangle, so you could choose to, for example, to draw AB as 10cm, and then from the ends of it, draw 5cm and 6cm arcs. Example

Draw a triangle with two sides 8cm and 6cm with an included angle of 40o .

Note: the 'included angle', means the one between the two lines.



To draw the above, the procedure was to:





draw the horizontal line AB, 8cm long

use a protractor to draw a line at 40o to AB

mark the point C, 6cm along the line

join C to B





Drawing an equilateral triangle

We draw a horizontal line, and mark a point A. Then set a pair of compasses to, say, 6 cm and draw a large arc using A as the centre. In the following the arc cuts the horizontal line at B:



Without altering the compasses, draw another arc, using B as the centre, to cut the first arc - at C in above diagram.

Since the compasses were not altered, then AB = AC = BC. So we just join these together to get the equilateral triangle ABC.

This is a method of producing an equilateral triangle but can also be used if we just want to draw a 60o angle, since all the angles inside the triangle are 60o .



Bisector of an angle





To 'bisect' something means to divide it into equals halves





Here we want to bisect the angle ABC by the line BD. The following is the final diagram, and the procedure to produce it is after the diagram:

with B as the centre, use a pair of compasses to draw arcs of equal radius to cut AB and BC

using the points where the arcs cut AB and BC, draw two more arcs of equal radius, such that they cut each other

draw BD though the point where the arcs cut





Perpendicular bisector of a line

Here we want to draw the 'perpendicular bisector' of line AB, i.e. a line at right angles to AB and which divides AB in half:





With A and then B as the centre, draw arc of equal radius above and below AB, so that the arc cross as shown (the radius must be something bigger than half of AB, or else the arcs will not cross)

Draw the line CD as shown - this is the required perpendicular bisector of AB

TRIGONOMETRY





* * *





TRIGONOMETRY - contents In a right-angled triangle, apart from the right-angle and the hypotenuse, there are two other angles and two other sides.

Relative to one of the other two angles, such as A in the diagram below:





one of the other two sides is opposite to A, and

the other side is adjacent to A





We define the following quantities for angle A:

We shorten sine to sin , cosine to cos and tangent to tan , so the above can be expressed as:



Note: We usually use degrees for measuring angles, but there are other angle units also used, called 'rads' (short for radians) and 'grads'. You may have a button labelled DRG on your calculator, which lets you change between degrees, rads and grads. Check that your calculator is set for degrees before doing the following example:

Example

Work out sin A and then the angle A in the triangle:



Do the above calculation on your calculator.

To get the angle A, what you now press will depend on the type of calculator.

You will probably have to press either inv sin or sin-1 or 2nF sin .

You should get the answer 36.9o (to 1 d.p.)

Note - on some calculators you would have to press sin-1 and then enter (3/5) and then press 'equals'.

Example

Repeat the above, but use (i) cos A and (ii) tan A



Example



To use sines etc. you need to identify the hypotenuse of the triangle and then the opposite and adjacent for the angle you're interested in.

The hypotenuse is opposite the right-angle, so that is the 5, as before.





The opposite to B is now the 4 and the adjacent to B is the 3.





We could use any of sin B, cos B or tan B - let's use sin B:

Check : Recall that the angles in a triangle always add up to 180o

In the above triangle, we have A = 36.9o , B = 53.1o , and the right angle, which is 90o

We see that 36.9o + 53.1o + 90o = 180o , as it should be.

Note:





sines, cosines and tangents are called trigonometric functions - they are all expressed as ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle

trigonometry is the branch of maths concerned with the properties and uses of trigonometric functions - trigonometry has important applications in surveying and navigation etc.





Sine, cosine and tangent for any size angle

We've already seen the basic definitions of sine ('sin'), cosine ('cos') and tangent ('tan') for a right-angled triangle:





In the above triangle, angle A can vary between 0o and 90o . However, the above definitions can be extended so that we can find sine etc., for any angles from 0o to 360o .

Suppose that we redraw the triangle as below. We see that the x-y axes create four 'quadrants', and we draw the triangle in the 1st quadrant. The opposite to angle A is now the y-coordinate of the point labelled P:



Sin A is positive in the 1st quadrant, i.e. for A between 0o and 90o , because y is positive in the first quadrant (and we always take h to be positive).

Now, if for any value of A we think of the 'opposite' side to A as being the y-coordinate of the point P, we can work out sin A for any angle. The sign (i.e. positive or negative) of sinA will depend on the sign of y (since h is always positive):



Check that your calculator is set to degrees (not rads or grads), and calculate the sines for the angles below - and notice that the values are always between +1 and -1:



The way that sinA varies can be seen better if the above points are used to plot a graph:





By using the length h and the coordinates of point P to work out sin etc. we can work out the values of sin, cos and tan for any angles, as indicated below:

Notice that sin, cos and tan are all positive in the first quadrant, but only one of them is positive in each of the other quadrants.





The following ACTS as a reminder of which is positive in each quadrant:





We can work out cos and tan for angles from 0o and 360o , and then plot their graphs, as below:

Cosine for all angles





Tangent for all angles

If you enter 90o or 270o in your calculator and press tan, you will get an error message. This is because as the angle approaches 90o or 270o the tan value heads for plus or minus infinity - so we avoid these angles in the table below:



Calculate tan for some angles close to 90o , and see how rapidly it changes - for example try:





89.9o , 89.99o , 89.999o , ... and

90.1o , 90.01o , 90.001o , ...





The graph for tan is quite different to that for sin or cos:



Solving any triangle - the sine and cosine rules

If we can work out all three sides of a triangle and all three angles, then we say that the triangle is 'solved'.

For right-angled triangles we can apply:





Pythagoras' theorem

the trigonometric ratios: sine, cosine or tangent





Also, if we know 2 angles in a triangle, we can find the third since, for any triangle:



the sum of interior three angles = 180o





The sine and cosine rules are useful because they apply to any triangle, whether it has a right-angle or not:





Notice that we label each angle of the triangle and the side opposite to it with the same letter, one large and the other small





Example

Solve the following equation:





In a given problem, you can label the sides and angles any way you like, but it helps avoid confusion when using the above rules if you make sure that the side a and the angle A (etc.) are opposite to each other.





Example



Find the unknown length in the following triangle:





If we label the unknown side as 'a', we can use the cosine rule, written as a2 = b2 + c2 - (2bc cosA):

BEARINGS - contents The following represents points on a compass.





North, South, East and West (N, S, E and W) are called the cardinal directions.A compass is useful for finding direction because its needle always point to the North Pole, and once you know that direction, you can work out the rest.

Half way between the cardinal directions are the directions NE (north east) etc.





A bearing is the direction of one point relative to another, expressed as an angle





In the following, the bearing of P from Q can be expressed as N60o E (said as 'north 60 degrees east'):





An commonly used alternate notation is to state a bearing as a 3 digit angle measured from the North in a clockwise direction.



In the above case, the bearing N60o E is the same as the bearing 060o





Other examples:



N is 000o

E is 090o

SW is 225o

N7o E is 007o





If you were just given two points, such as P and Q in the last diagram, and asked for the bearing of P from Q, you could:



draw a vertical line at Q (pointing North)

rotate it until it passed through P

measure or calculate the angle of rotation - this is the required bearing of P from Q





In the following, the bearing of P from Q is 240o :





The above bearing is directly opposite to the bearing of 060o in the previous diagram, and notice that 240o = 60o + 180o .

ANGLES OF ELEVATION AND DEPRESSION - start of this chapter - contents An angle of elevation is measured upwards from the horizontal line of sight:





An angle of depression is measured downwards from the horizontal line of sight:

SCALES - start of this chapter - contents Models are usually made to scale, and maps are usually drawn to scale.





The scale is the ratio between a length on a model or map to the corresponding length on the real thing





A half scale model of you would be a model made with a ratio of 1:2, so, for example, if you are 1.8m tall, then the model would be half of this, 0.9m tall.Map scales are often expressed as a ratio, for example, 1:50000, or as a fraction, for example, 1/50000 (a scale of 'one to fifty thousand'). Notice that there are no units placed in the scale, so we can use any convenient unit such as cm, metres, feet or whatever. So, for example, we can interpret the scale as meaning that a distance of 1cm on the map represents a distance of 50000cm on the ground.

A scale might also be expressed as in terms of actual distance, for example, 1cm = 1km. This means that an actual one cm on the map represents one kilometre on the ground.

Example

A map has a scale of 1:50000. Two villages are 10cm apart on the map. How far apart are they in reality?

1 cm on the map represents 50000 cm on the ground.

So, 10 cm on the map represents 10*50000 cm = 500000 cm.

We divide cm by 100 to get metres. So, 500000 cm = 500000/100 m = 5000 m.

We divide metres by 1000 to get kilometres (km). So, the distance between the villages = 5000/1000 km = 5 km.

LOCI (this is plural of 'locus') - start of this chapter - contents



All the points on a circle have something in common - they are all exactly the same distance ('equidistant') from the centre. In the above diagram, all the points on the circle are a distance r, the radius of the circle, from the centre C.We can think of a circle as being a collection of points which satisfy the rule or condition that they are all the same distance from a fixed point.

To be general, we say that:





A locus is a set of points or lines whose location satisfies one or more conditions - in the above case, the locus of points which are equidistant from a fixed point is a circle, with the fixed point at the centre





Example Draw the locus which is 2cm from the straight line AB.





Answer:





Example Draw the locus which is equidistant from both points A and B.





Answer:



Example A distress signal from a boat has been picked up at coastguard stations at A and B. It is estimated that the boat is within 5km of A and within 8km of B. Indicate on the diagram the region where the coastguards should concentrate their search.





We draw an arc of radius 5cm centred on A - this is the locus of all points on the sea within 5cm (5km) of A

We draw an arc of radius 8cm centred on B - this is the locus of all points on the sea within 8cm (8km) of B





All of the region of overlap of the circles is within 5km of A and within 8 km of B, so this is probably where the boat is, and so is where the coastguards should search.

2D and 3 D loci

The above are examples of two dimensional ('2D') loci, which can be draw on a sheet of paper.

However, we can also have three dimensional ('3D') loci:





The locus of all points equidistant from a point in all directions is a sphere, with the point at the centre

The locus of all point equidistant from a line is a cylinder, with the line at its centre

TESSELLATIONS - start of this chapter - contents



Tessellations are patterns formed by placing identical shapes (called congruent shapes) such that they cover an area without any gaps between the shapes





For example, identical tiles can be placed to cover a surface exactly, i.e. with no gaps in between the tiles - this is practical tessellation which has been done for centuries.All triangles will tessellate:



Squares and rectangles will tessellate:



Rhombuses will tessellate:



Regular hexagons will tessellate:





Tessellation rule for regular polygons

There are six angles inside a hexagon, called its interior angles. We see in the above diagram that the interior angles of 3 neighbouring hexagons add up to exactly 360o . If they did not, then there would either be a gap between the shapes or the shapes would overlap, i.e. they would not tessellate.

In the above case, the interior angle is 120o , and 360o /120o equals the whole number 3, which is the number of hexagons meeting at the point indicated. This is a general rule for regular polygons :





Any regular polygon will tessellate if its interior angle divides exactly into 360o





Consider a regular pentagon. The interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108o , and 360o /108o = 3.3. This is not a whole number, so a regular pentagon will not tessellate:



Also, a regular octagon will not tessellate. Its interior angle is 135o and 360o /135o = 2.7.

Notice that the gaps are squares, so regular octagons combined with squares do tessellate (such designs are often used in tiling).

VECTORS





* * *





VECTORS - contents



distance is just a number of metres or yards etc., e.g. 10m or 25yards

speed is a distance moved per second or per hour etc., e.g. 20m/s or 30mph

displacement is a distance moved in a particular direction , e.g. 10 m to the right

velocity is a speed in a particular direction , e.g. 20m/s straight up





The above are examples of two types of quantities - definition:



A scalar quantity has magnitude (or size) only - for example, distance and speed

A vector quantity has magnitude and direction - for example, displacement and velocity





In the following, the various vectors are displacement vectors, i.e. those which indicate movement from one place to another, but other sorts of vectors, such as velocity, have just the same properties.In a diagram, we can represent a vector by a line with an arrow somewhere along it - for example, the following represent a displacement from A to B and from C to D and from E to F:



The letters with an arrow on top are one type of notation used to represent a vector. We also represents a vector by a letter written in bold or an ordinary letter underlined - for example:

For the first displacement vector a , moving directly from A to B is equivalent to moving 7 squares to the right from A along the x axis and then 7 squares up along the y axis. These values of x and y are the called the components of the vector a along the x and y axes.Vector b is composed of zero movement in the x direction, but 9 squares along the negative y axis.

Vector c is composed of moving 6 squares along the x axis and 3 along the negative y axis.

We can express the vectors in terms of their x and y components as:



In this form we refer to the vectors as column vectors .Consider the displacement vectors a and b :



Their column vectors are:



From any particular starting point, vector a or vector b would take you 6 squares in the x direction and 3 squares in the y direction, and so lead to the same final position - so the vectors are the same, so:



Two vectors are the same if they have the same column vector





Magnitude (or size) of a vector

The magnitude or size of a vector is simply its length , and we can work it out from its components.



Consider the vector:





The vector and its x and y components make a right-angled triangle, so we can use Pythagoras' Theorem:

The magnitude is taken as the positive square root.



Multiplying a vector by a number

To multiply a vector by a number, simply multiply each component of its column vector by the number:





Working out the magnitudes we get:





Addition

Suppose that we have the following two vectors, and want to add them:



In a real situation, if these were displacement vectors, adding them would mean that, from a certain position, you would move the distance and direction indicated by a and then the move the distance and direction indicated by b . So adding them means following each one in succession - which means that we just join the vectors nose-to-tail:



If we join the start of a to the end of b , we get a new vector, c . We can see that following the vector c is the same as following a and then b , so c is the result of adding a and b , and is called their resultant vector. To produce the column vector of c we add the x and y values of the column vectors of a and b :





Subtraction

Suppose that we start with the same two vectors as in the above addition but this time:





we want to determined a - b





Now a - b is the same as a + (-b ). We know from earlier that -b is a vector the same as b but opposite in direction:

We now add these as before:

TRANSFORMATIONS





* * *





TRANSFORMATIONS - contents To transform (or 'map') something involves some sort of change. The following are all types of transformations:

1. Translations

This simply means that the original figure is moved from one place to another (slid left, right, up or down).

Consider:



The original figure, the 'object', has been moved to the right, producing the 'image'. To find the distance moved, look at one point on the object and the corresponding point on the image. For example, point A has moved 15cm to become point A'. All the points have moved the same distance.

To describe a translation, we state:





the distance moved, and

the direction moved





Thus, the above translation is 15cm to the right. To describe the transformation fully we would say:



the transformation which maps figure ABCDE to figure A'B'C'D'E' is a translation of 15cm to the right





Since a translation is a distance moved in a certain direction, we can represent a translation by a vector . Example



The vector means that each point on the object is moved 8 squares in the x direction (right) and 7 squares in the negative y direction (down). This is done to each of A, B and C to locate A', B' and C', which are then joined together:





2. Rotations

To describe a rotation, we state:





the centre of rotation

the angle of rotation

the direction of rotation (clockwise or anticlockwise)





Example Rotate the following triangle by 90o clockwise, about the centre X:



From the original vertices A, B and C (a vertex is where two lines meet) we need to locate the new vertices A', B' and C'.From X, we draw a line XA. We rotate this line by 90o clockwise, and mark A', such that XA' = XA.

We repeat this to locate B' and C', and then complete the new triangle:



You may be given two figures, the original object and its image, and asked to describe the rotational transformation that maps the object to the image. The method can be illustrated using the result of the previous example:

Example

Describe fully the transformation that maps ABC to A'B'C':



We need to state the direction and angle of rotation, and the centre of rotation.

The direction and angle are found by comparing two corresponding edges. We see that AB has been rotated by 90o clockwise to produce A'B'.

To find the centre of rotation:





join two corresponding points with a straight line and draw the perpendicular bisector to the line (i.e. a line in the middle, at 90o ) - in the 1st dia. below, the line AA' has been drawn, and the perpendicular bisector PP drawn to this

repeat this with two other corresponding points - this has been done with CC' in the 2nd diagram below





The centre of rotation X is the point where the two perpendicular bisectors cross:

To describe the transformation fully we would say:





the transformation which maps figure ABC to figure A'B'C' is a rotation of 90o clockwise about the centre of rotation X





3. Enlargements

When we enlarge something we change its size.

In the following the figure ABCDE has been enlarged by a scale factor of 2:



Every edge has been doubled in length, but all the angles are still the same. Thus, the image is similar to the object.

Though the word 'enlarge' means 'to make bigger', we also use the same term when the scale factor is less than 1, in which case the image is smaller than the object - for example, applying a scale factor of 1/2 to the above object gives:



Another way of making an enlargement is by using a scale factor and a centre of enlargement :

Example

Produce the enlargement of the figure below using the centre O, and scale factor 2:



Procedure:

From O draw straight lines through each vertex

Mark A' at a distance 2*OA from O

Repeat (2) for all the vertices

Join the points A' to B' etc. to produce the image



It may be helpful to produce a table as above. But if the object is on a grid, it is possible to move the appropriate number of positions in the x and y directions to find each new point. For example, D is 2 right and 1 up from O, so D' is 4 right and 2 up from O.

Note: The centre of enlargement can be anywhere, inside or outside the object, but the procedure is the same.

Also,



The next example illustrates the reverse procedure - finding the scale factor and centre of enlargement.

Example

Find the scale factor and the centre of enlargement of the following, given that AB = 1cm and A'B' = 2cm:





Now, we draw lines though corresponding vertices - they cross at the centre of enlargement, O:





The next example indicates the meaning of a negative scale factor: Example

Draw the image of the following object using the centre of enlargement O, with a scale factor of -2:





When a scale factor is negative, the image is on the opposite side of the centre of enlargement





4. Reflections

Here we reflect the triangle ABC about the mirror line indicated:





The mirror line represents a mirror seen edge-on, so it just appears as a straight line. The image is formed just as it would be in a real mirror. The procedure is:



From point A, draw a perpendicular to the mirror, and extend it beyond the mirror to produce the image point A'. The image point A' is as far behind the mirror as the object point A is in front

This is repeated to produce an image point from each object point - as in the left-hand diagram below

The image points are now joined to produce the image - as in the right-hand diagram below





The object and image are said to be oppositely congruent - if you cut them out, and turn one over , it exactly fits on the other.

Example

Locate the mirror line for the object and image below.



The procedure is: Draw a line between two corresponding points on the object and the image (left-hand diagram below)

Draw a line in the middle of the line and at 90o to it - this is called the perpendicular bisector, and is the required mirror line

UNITS

AREAS OF PLANE SURFACES

VOLUMES OF CUBES AND CUBOIDS





* * *





UNITS - contents It would not mean very much to say that a particular piece of string is '5 long'. We need to say whether we mean 5 inches, 5 yards, 5 cm, 5 metres, 5 miles or whatever. Inches, yards, cm, etc. are all units of length.

For many year Britain has used Imperial units . These include:





inches and feet for length

pints and gallons for volume

ounces and pounds for mass (or weight)





Europe uses the metric system, and this is now used more and more in Britain.In the metric system the units are based on multiples of 10.



Mass



A small teaspoon of water has a mass of about 1 gram.

One tonne is also called a 'metric tonne' (it is not the same as the Imperial ton used in Britain)



Length

One centimetre is about the width of a little finger. One kilometre is about half a mile.



Note: 1 m = 100 cm = 100*10 mm = 1000 mm.



Volume (or capacity)



Note: An italic l has been used above, simply so that it does not look like a number 1 (many typewriters and computers use the number '1' to stand for the small letter 'l ').

A mass of 1 g of water has a volume of 1 ml , so a small teaspoon of water is about 1 ml of water.

Compound measures arise when a quantity involves more than one unit. For example, by definition:





So, if a mass of 1 g of water has a volume of 1 ml , then the density of water is 1g/ml (one gram per millilitre).

Approximate equivalents between Imperial and metric units





1kg is about 2.2 pounds

8km is about 5 miles

1 metre is about 39 inches

1 foot is about 30.5cm

1 litre is about 0.2 gallons





Example The Chancellor of the Exchequer has just increased petrol by 4 pence a litre. Approximately how much is that per gallon?





1 litre is about 0.2 gallons, so

5 litres is about 1 gallon.





So, we multiply the price increase by 5. The increase per gallon is approximately 5 * 4 = 20 pence Example

The speed limit of a certain road in France is 80 km per hour. What is that approximately in miles per hour?





8km is about 5 miles, so

80 km is about 50 miles, so

80 km per hour is about 50 miles per hour





* * *





AREAS OF PLANE SURFACES ('plane' means 'flat') - start of this chapter - contents Squares and rectangles

A 1cm by 1cm square has an area of 1cm2 ('one square cm').





A square 3cm by 3cm is made up of nine 1cm2 :



We see that the area equals 3cm * 3cm = 9cm2 .A rectangle 3cm by 4cm is made up of twelve 1cm2 :



We see that the area equals 3cm * 4cm = 12cm2 .

In general, the area of a square or rectangle is found using:



Note:



the units must be the same for both length and breadth - e.g. both in cm gives area in cm2

the order doesn't matter: length * breadth = breadth * length





Triangles

The area of any triangle equals half the area of a suitable rectangle:



Thus, we can express the area of a triangle in terms of the area of a rectangle:



However, sometimes the vertical height may not be known - in which case there is an alternate equation that can be used. We can find the area of any triangle if we know the length of two sides and the included angle, i.e. the one between them:





Example

Find the area of the triangle:





area = 0.5 * 5 * 6 * sin30 = 7.5 cm2



Parallelograms





If we draw a diagonal (in either direction) across the parallelogram, we get two triangles, and we already have a formula for the area of a triangle:

Trapeziums





From above, we already know that the area of a parallelogram equals base*height, and so if we can change the trapezium into a parallelogram, we can find its area:





Circles

Figures do not have to have straight edges in order to have areas.



Example

Find the total area of the following circle, and the areas of the major and minor sectors:





* * *





VOLUMES OF CUBES AND CUBOIDS - start of this chapter - contents A 1cm by 1cm by 1cm cube has a volume of 1cm3 ('one cubic cm').





A cube 3cm by 3cm by 3cm is made up of twenty seven 1cm3 :

We see that the volume equals 3cm * 3cm * 3cm = 27cm3 .A cuboid 3cm by 3cm by 4cm is made up of thirty six 1cm3 :



We see that the volume equals 3cm * 3cm * 4cm = 36 cm3 .In general, the volume of a cube or cuboid is found using:



Note:





the units must be the same for all of length, breadth and height - e.g. all in cm gives volume in cm3

the order that length, breadth and height are multiplied does not matter





Use of isometric paper Isometric paper is used by, for example, engineers, to help represent 3D (3 dimensional) objects in 2D. The paper is made up tessellations of equilateral triangles. The following represents a cuboid drawn on isometric paper:

* * *





AREAS AND VOLUMES OF VARIOUS 3D OBJECTS - contents Cubes

The cross shape below is called a net of the cube. The net can be cut out and folded to form the cube:



The surface area of the cube is equal to the surface are of its net, so:





surface area of a cube = 6 * area of one face of the cube





A cube can also have other nets, but they also have the same surface area as the cube:



Prisms

A prism is any solid with a uniform (=constant, unchanging) cross-section. The name of a prism is usually taken from the shape of its cross-section:



We can work out the volume and surface area of a prism with any shape cross-section the same way, so we use the following diagram to represent any prism:



The net of the above prism is:



The surface area equals the two cross sections added, plus the area of the rectangular part. So, in general:



Pyramids

A pyramid has a polygon for a base, and sloping triangular sides which meet at a point (the apex).

In a 'right pyramid', the apex is directly over the centre C of the base (in a 'skew pyramid', it is not).

The right pyramid is the one we usually mean when we simply refer to a 'pyramid'.



If the pyramid were made of cardboard, we could just cut along its edges and lay it flat to produce its net. The net of a square-based pyramid looks like:





Notice that for the square-based pyramid the triangles are congruent (identical).



Cones

A 'circular cone' has a circular base.

As with pyramids, the 'right cone' has its apex directly over the centre of the circle.



If we cut out the circular base and cut along the slant length, we can flatten the cone out into its net - this produces a circle, and a sector of another circle:





Spheres



If a sphere is cut in half, the volume is halved, but for the total area we need to now include the area of the circular cross-section:

Example

A golf ball has a diameter of 4.27cm. What is its surface area and volume? State the answers to one decimal place.

The equations for area and volume use radius, rather than diameter:

The radius, r = diameter/2 = 4.27/2 = 2.135cm





* * *





DIMENSIONS AND FORMULAE - start of this chapter - contents If we think of length as having 1 dimension, then area has 2 dimensions and volume has 3 dimensions:



Notice that the power of the unit is the same as the number of dimensions - either 1 , 2 or 3 (recall that cm is the same as cm1 ).

We can study a formula, and from its dimensions, determine if it could represents a length, an area or a volume.

One way is to replace any variable standing for length by, say, cm:





if the formula produces cm then it could be a formula for a length

if the formula produces cm2 then it could be a formula for an area

if the formula produces cm3 then it could be a formula for a volume





Example



If we replace r by cm, we get r2 = cm2 .

But the unit of volume is cm3 , so the formula must be wrong.

(if you check back, you'll see that the r2 in the student's formula should be r3 )

Example



If we replace r and L by cm:





in the 1st term: r2 has the unit cm2

in the 2nd term: r L2 has the unit cm*cm2 = cm3





The first term has the unit of area, but the second term has the unit of volume, so the formula cannot represents an area.Note: It is a general point that:





all terms in any equation/formula must have the same units





Example In the following, L, h and r all represent lengths. Which formula could not represent a volume?





2Lhr

L(r + h)

Lr3





Putting cm in place of each length:



The unit of 2Lhr = cm*cm*cm = cm3 , so this could be a volume

The unit of L(r + h) = unit of Lr + Lh. Both terms have the unit cm*cm = cm2 , which is an area unit, not a volume unit

The unit of Lr3 is cm*cm3 = cm4 , which is not a volume unit

Part 4: HANDLING DATA - contents Statistics (Chapters 21 to 23)

Chapter 21



TERMINOLOGY

REPRESENTING DATA VISUALLY

STATISTICAL SURVEYS





* * *





TERMINOLOGY - contents





Statistics is concerned with collecting, analysing (processing) and representing data.





Data is a collection of observation. For example, a set of exam results is data. Information gathered about a group of people's favourite TV programs is data. Raw data is a collection of facts which has not been processed in any way.

A population is everyone or everything in a sample being considered. If you were recording the ages of students in a class, all the students would be in the population. If you were considering the make of cars in a car park, all the cars would be in the population (so a populations does not always refer to people).

A variable is anything that can vary (be different) from one item to another. For example, ages of students in a classroom or the makes of cars in a car park are variables.

Qualitative variables are those such as the colour or make of a car, which are not numerical.

Quantitative variables are numerical - these may be discrete or continuous:





Discrete variables are those which can only take certain particular values, but not in-between values



The number of children in a classroom might be, for example, 17 or 18, but not 17.4. So the number of children is a discrete variable.

Discrete variables are not necessarily whole numbers. For example, shoe sizes are discrete, but a size may be, for example, 8½, as well as 8 or 9 etc.





Continuous variables are those which can take any value, usually between certain limits

For example, between the shortest and tallest child in a class, the other children might have any height.

Similarly, the age of a person might be anything from zero to over a hundred.





Data is often represented in ways which make it easier to see patterns in the data. Some of the following may be familiar from their use on TV and in newspapers etc.



* * *





REPRESENTING DATA VISUALLY - start of this chapter - contents A student makes notes about 60 cars and their drivers as they enter a car park.





The above is called a frequency distribution or a frequency table . It indicates the frequency of each variable (i.e. the number of times each occurs). For example, the frequency of men with blue cars is 9, while the frequency of women with green cars is 4, etc.





Data such as the above can be conveniently represented by a bar chart or a pie chart . These represent the variables and the frequencies in a single diagram.

Bar charts

In a bar chart (or bar graph ) we draw bars of equal width (sometimes we may just use lines).

There are various types of bar charts that can be used:

1. A vertical bar chart

The following is a vertical bar chart, representing the total number of cars of each colour:



Notice that:





the length of a bar is proportional to the frequency - if we add all the lengths we get the total number of cars, i.e. 60

the bars or 'towers' do not touch

there is no horizontal scale, just descriptions of the quantities (the variables)

the graph is given a title (to describe it), and both the axes are labelled





2. A horizontal bar chart





3. A proportionate bar chart (also called a component bar chart or a stacked bar chart)

This allows us to indicate the car colours and sex of drivers on the same chart:





4. A comparative bar chart

This is as the above, except that the bars representing numbers of men and women are placed side by side:





Pie charts

Recall the original data:





Here we will just consider the total number of each colour.In the pie chart representation below, each segment of the 'pie' represents a car colour. The size of each segment represents the number of cars of each colour:





Procedure :A complete circle contains 360o , and to divide the pie into the appropriate proportions, we need to work out the angle corresponding to the number of cars of each colour.





It's worth adding up all the angles, to check that they come to 360o .





To draw the pie chart:



draw a circle of a convenient size

mark the centre

draw a radius (anywhere, but it may be easiest to draw a horizontal radius)

use a protractor to draw in the other radii

label each sector appropriately





Assuming that the first radius has been drawn horizontally to the right, the following indicates how to place a protractor to mark the radius for the black cars, and then the radius relative to this for the white cars.



The process continues for all the other colours. When the first four sectors are complete, the 5th is automatically complete - you should measure it to see if it is 132o , as it should be.

Pictograms

These are a pictoral way of representing data.

The following is meant to represent the increase in milk consumption in the UK between 1950 and 1980:





However, it is not clear whether we are meant to compare heights, widths or areas, each of which gives a different proportional increase.The following is a way of making the information clearer:





Chronological graphs (or time-series graphs)

These are used to represent the change in one or more quantities over a time period:

time is usually plotted along the horizontal axis





The following indicates the number of employees working for a company over a few years:





And the following is the data represented as a chronological graph (or chart):

Scatter diagrams

If we collect data about two different quantities, there may or may not be a relationship (called a 'correlation') between them.

We might expect a relationship between the age of a child, and his or her shoe size. But would probably not expect a relationship between the height of a student and their exam results.

The following are examples of scatter diagrams in which we simply plot one quantity against the other to see if the graphs reveals any apparent relationship:



A positive correlation (relationship) exists between two quantities if one increases when the other increases

A negative correlation exists between two quantities if one decreases when the other increases

If two quantities seem to be completely independent, we say that there is no correlation between them





We would expect, for example, that the size of a child's shoe to increase with age, up to a certain limit, so these quantities have a positive correlation.But for an adult, shoe size changes little, if at all, with age, so there is little or no correlation between the quantities.

Various terms are used to describe the amount of correlation:





little or no correlation

moderate positive correlation

moderate negative correlation

strong positive correlation

strong negative correlation





It may be that the points on a scatter diagram seem to lie close to a line - in which case we can draw, by eye, a line of best fit . The following represent strong positive correlation, and a line of best fit has been drawn through each set of points:

STATISTICAL SURVEYS - start of this chapter - contents These involve obtaining data from people by asking questions or using questionnaires. It may be that the relevant population (the parent population) is millions of people, in which case only a relatively few would be questioned. For this to be worthwhile, those questioned must be representative of the whole population .

For example, suppose that in order to obtain a prediction about the voting in an upcoming general election, the sampling method was to ask 10 men at football match in Rotherham how they planned to vote.

This would be a poor sampling method because:





a very small sample of the voting population has been used

they are all men

they were not randomly selected from the voting population - they all happened to be at the same place at the same time

they are all in one town





In short, the 10 men are not a representative sample of the voting population. To improve the method, we could:



use a larger sample, say 1000

ask men and women

select them at random from those of voting age

do the survey in a variety of locations, town and country





Sampling methods and bias





Random sampling . In this case every member of a population has an equal chance of being chosen. One approach is to pick names at random from a list of the names in the relevant population

Stratified random sampling . A population may contain groupings, and these groupings can be reflected in the way a sample of the population is chosen - this is better than just random sampling of the whole population. For example, if a population contains equal numbers of men and women, and a sample of 100 were required, then 50 of each would be randomly selected. The sample is then in the same proportion as the population.





A survey is said the be biased when the sample of the population selected is not representative of the whole population.



An advantage of using random sampling or stratified random sampling is that it helps to avoid bias

AVERAGES

DISPERSION OF DATA





* * *





AVERAGES - contents The following is raw data made up of results from a maths test:



When we state an average value of a set of data, we are representing all the data by a single number. In statistics, averages are thought of as 'measures of central tendency'. There are three different averages used, called mean , median and mode :

1. Mean (also called arithmetic mean )





The mean of a set of values equals the sum of all of them divided by how many values there are, so:





The mean value is what most people think of as being an average value - but the following two averages are also used in statistics.

2. Median





The median of a set of values is the data value which occurs in the middle when the values are arranged in ascending (increasing) order





If the above test results are put in order we get:

There are 17 entries, and the middle one, the 9th, is 5, so the median is 5.

If there are an even number of entries, there is not a single middle entry - in this case the median equals the middle two data values added together and divided by 2. For example, for the data:



The median = (6+7)/2 = 6.5



3. Mode





The mode is the data value which occurs most often (most frequently)





For the following set of values, the mode is 6:

Some sets of values do not have a mode. In the following, each value occurs once:

1 2 3 4 7 9 12

Some sets of values have more than one mode. For example, the following have the modes 4 and 7, since these both occur 3 times, which is more than any of the other values:

1 1 2 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 7 7 7 8 9 9

Memory jogger : The following may help you avoid mixing up mode with the other two averages:





think of MODE as standing for M ost O ften D ata E ntry





* * *





DISPERSION OF DATA (Note: 'to disperse' means 'to spread out') - start of this chapter - contents Sets of data may be compared using their mean, median and mode. However:





a disadvantage of using an average value to represent a set of data is that it does not tell you how spread out (disperse) the data is





For example, the following have the same mean value, but the data entries are spread out very differently about the mean:



the mean of 102 and 104 = (102 + 104)/2 = 206/2 = 103

the mean of 2 and 204 = (2 + 204)/2 = 206/2 = 103





Hence, in addition to the idea of averages, in statistics we define quantities which provide us with measures of spread or dispersion of data. 1. Range

This measures spread simply as how far apart the biggest and smallest items of data are:





range = maximum value - minimum value





In the set of data: 1 2 6 7 9 13 15, the range = 15 -1 = 14



One disadvantage to using range as a measure of spread, is that it depends only on the extreme values, i.e. the highest and lowest data values, and tells you nothing about the in-between values





2. Interquartile range

Before defining interquartile range, we need to define the term 'quartile':





the quartiles of a set of data are those data values which divide the data into four equal parts, i.e. into four quarters, after the data has been arranged in numerical order





The second quartile is the same as the median, since the median divides the data into 2 halves, and a half is the same as two quarters.The following represents15 pieces of data, arranged in increasing size from 5 to 24. The diagram indicates the quartiles and what we mean by the term 'interquartile range':



The quartiles occur at the 4th , 8th , and 12th positions out of the 15 pieces of data.

To be more general, if we let the letter n stand for any number of pieces of data then, we can work out the quartiles according to:



To relate this to the previous data, replace n by 15, and see that the 1st quartile is the ¼(15+1)th = 4th value etc.

If n is fairly large, then adding 1 to it does not make much difference, so the first quartile value is the ¼ nth value rather than the ¼(n+1)th value etc.

What if the quartiles do not coincide with particular items of data? Consider the data:



For these the 2nd quartile (the median) is the ½(10+1)th value = the 5½th value. But what does the 'fifth and a halfth' value mean? We interpret this as being between the 5th and 6th value, so the 2nd quartile is the mean of these:





second quartile (= median) = ½ (6+7) = 6.5





Note that:



An advantage of using interquartile range is that it provides a better measure of spread than ordinary range, because it does not depend on the extreme values of the data





3. Standard deviation

Note - you should check with your teacher or your syllabus which equations you will be given in the exams - you would probably be given the next one if you needed it.

The following is the definition of standard deviation (it is provided in the examination) - it contains some symbols not used so far:





The quantity inside the square root sign is called the 'variance', i.e.





Example The following are points scored in 11 games of rugby:

13, 23, 45, 11, 56, 32, 75, 17, 29, 62, 19

Calculate the standard deviation of the scores.We set up a table to list the above scores and then work out:





the mean value of the scores

the deviation of each score from the mean

the squares of the deviations





Now we can complete the question:



Note:





Remember that standard deviation is a measure of spread (deviation) - the more spread out the values are from the mean value, the greater the standard deviation

An advantage of using the standard deviation is that it includes every item of data (unlike the range or the interquartile range)

Chapter 23



FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS

GROUPED FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS





* * *





FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS - contents As previously mentioned:





the frequency of a item of data is the number of times that it occurs, and

by counting the frequency of each item of data we obtain a frequency distribution or a frequency table





The following are exam marks out of 10 for 36 students:



The above is raw data. One way to produce a frequency distribution from the raw data is to use a tally chart . In the left-hand column we list each different value that occurs in the data - we see that numbers from 1 to 9 occur. Then, in the tally column, we put a 1 for each time a value occurs. Usually, when we reach 5, the fifth entry is indicated by putting a line through a group of four:

To complete the tally column, you could simply count all the 1s in the data, then all the 2s etc. However, it is easy to miss an item doing this. It is usually better to work though the data in order, crossing off each item as it is used - so you could, for example:



start top left in the data, working along each row in turn

put a 1 against each mark in the table as that mark occurs in the data

cross off each mark of data when it has been recorded in the table





Since the frequency column contains the number of times each mark occurs, the total frequency must equal the total number of marks. You should add up the total frequency as a check - if it does not equal the total number of items in the data, then you've missed something or counted something more than once.

Mode of a frequency distribution

MODE = Most Often Data Entry - so it is the data item that occurs most frequently. We can see directly from the frequency distribution table that the mode of the data is 6, which occurs 8 times.

We could also draw a line graph (or line chart ), which is a bar graph in which we use lines in place of bars, and see from this that the mode is 6:





Mean of a frequency distribution

We can work out the mean of the above set of marks in the normal way, i.e. by adding them all together and dividing by how many there are:



But we can also do this by adding an extra column to the tally chart:



From the two totals, we get the mean = 172/36 = 4.8, as before.

We can represent the above procedure in a shorthand notation commonly used in statistics:



Adding these symbols to the above table, gives us:





Median of a frequency distribution

Arranging the original data in order we get:

1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 7 8 8 9 9 9

The median is the middle value. There are an even number (36) of values so we calculate the mean of the middle two, the 18th and 19th . These are both 5, so their mean is 5, which is the median value.

We can also find the median by producing a cumulative frequency distribution from the data. We do this by first of all forming a table. The entry in the cumulative frequency column is the total number of marks less than a specified value - compare the next table with the previous tally chart to see how the cumulative frequencies have been worked out:



The above is a 'less than' table. Sometimes a 'less than or equal table' may be used, in which the entry in the cumulative frequency is the total number of marks less than or equal to a specified value.

Notice that the final cumulative frequency, 36, is the total number of items of data.

Since there are 36 entries, the median is the average of the 18th and 19th values:

these do not fall in the 'less than 5' class, as this only has 16 members, so they must both be 5 or higher

they both fall in the class 'less than 6', since this has 22 members, so they must both be less than 6



Since the 18th and 19th values are both 5 or higher [from (1)], and both less than 6 [from (2)], then they must both be 5. So, the median is the average of 5 and 5, which is 5.



* * *





GROUPED FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS - start of this chapter - contents Showing the frequencies for individual data items, as for the marks in the above case, is fine when the number of different items is quite small. However, if there are lots of different items it is found to be more useful to group the items of data into classes, and count how many items are in each class - this is called a grouped frequency distribution.





A grouped frequency distribution indicates how many times items occur in each specified class





The following is the time to the nearest minute that 36 students took to complete an examination:



This time, we put a 1 in the tally column when a time falls in the specified range of values:

Some terminology:



The data has been grouped into five classes or class intervals

Class boundaries are the boundaries (or divides) between classes. Classes cannot overlap, or else an item of data might fall in two different classes. The times were recorded to the nearest minutes, so:





The class boundaries of the 10-14 class are 9.5 and 14.5 minutes - all those times greater than or equal to 9.5 minutes but less than 14.5 minutes fall in the 10-14 class

The class boundaries of the 15-19 class are 14.5 and 19.5 minutes - all those times greater than or equal to 14.5 minutes but less than 19.5 minutes fall in the 15-19 class

Hence, the class boundary between the 10-14 and 15-19 class is 14.5 minutes, since this is the divide between them

The other class boundaries are 19.5, 24.5, 29.5 and 34.5 minutes





A class width is the difference between the lower and upper class boundaries of a class. The class width is the same for all the above classes, for example, 14.5 - 9.5 = 5 minutes





Histograms

A histogram is like a bar chart, except:





the width of a rectangle now represents the class width

there are no gaps put between the classes, the rectangles touch each other along their sides

there are numbers along both axes





The following histogram represents the above grouped frequency distribution:

To construct the histogram:





mark the horizontal and vertical axes as shown with the maximum values and suitable scales

mark the class boundaries at 9.5, 14.5 etc. - since theses are where the vertical lines are to be drawn

draw rectangles of appropriate height at each pair of class boundaries

label both axes and give the histogram a title





An alternative representation to the histogram is a frequency polygon - this is produced from a histogram by joining the mid-points of the top of the rectangles by straight lines :

Notice that to complete the polygon, we:





join the middle of the first bar to middle of where the previous bar would be, at the point where frequency = zero

join the middle of the last bar to middle of where the next bar would be, at the point where frequency = zero





It is not be essential to draw the histogram in order to draw the polygon, but drawing the histogram does help in correctly locating the points to be joined to form the polygon.

Mode and modal class of a grouped frequency distribution

The mode of a set of data is the value that occurs most often, i.e. has the highest frequency.

In a grouped frequency distribution, we do not have individual frequencies shown on the histogram, but rather we have the frequencies for each class. However, we define:





the modal class of a distribution is the class with the highest frequency





The modal class for the above grouped frequency distribution is indicated below, together with a method of estimating the value of the mode from the histogram:



Mean of a grouped frequency distribution

We can find the mean in a similar way to previously for a frequency distribution. However, for the x values, we now use the mid-points of the various classes, as indicated below:



The above method of finding the mean is a bit of an approximation, as we can see if we work out the mean in the normal way:



Median of a grouped frequency distribution

Placing the original data in numerical order, we get:

10 11 12 13 14 15 16 16 17 18 19 21 21 21 22 22 22 22

23 23 23 24 24 24 24 25 25 26 26 27 27 28 29 31 32 34

The median (2nd quartile ) = the ½ (36+1)th value = 18½ value, i.e. the average of the 18th and 19th entry, which is (22+23)/2 = 22.5

We can also get an estimate of the median from a cumulative frequency distribution table for the data.

Here we use 14.5 etc. as the divisions between the classes, and then add up the total number of times below each division:





The table tells us that the 18th and 19th members fall somewhere in the class 'less than 24.5', but does not give a value for median as specific as the previous methodWe can get a better estimate for the median by plotting a cumulative frequency graph/curve :



Cumulative frequency graphs





a cumulative frequency curve is produced by plotting the points from the above table, and joining the points to form a smooth curve:





Cumulative frequency graphs are shaped like a stretched S, and are called 'ogives' (a term taken from architecture).

An advantage of a cumulative frequency curve is that we can get estimates of the 1st quartile (or lower quartile, LQ), the 2nd quartile (median) and 3rd quartile (or upper quartile, UQ) directly from the graph.

Recall that the 1st quartile is the ¼(n+1)th value. Since n=36, which is reasonably large compared to 1, we can use the approximations indicated below:



Recall that interquartile range = upper quartile - lower quartile = 25.5 - 18 = 7.5 minutes



Frequency density

Rather than draw a histogram of frequency (upwards) against class interval, some histograms are drawn with 'frequency density' on the vertical scale - definition:





In the data used for the previous histogram, the class interval was 5 for all the classes (e.g. 14.5 - 9.5 etc.). Applying the above definition to that data, we divide all the frequencies by 5 to get:

Note - Physical density is 'mass per unit volume ', for example, grams per cm3 . We use the term 'frequency density' in a similar way - it is the 'frequency per unit class interval '.

Drawing the histogram:



Given a histogram such as the above, we can work out the frequency of any particular class interval by reversing the calculation for frequency density:



Notes:

In the above type of histogram, with frequency density on the vertical axis :





the area of a column equals frequency (= frequency density * width of class interval) - this is so even if the columns have different class intervals

the sum of the areas of all the columns equals the total frequency





In the previous type of histogram, with frequency on the vertical axis :



the height of a column represents frequency

the sum of the heights of all the columns equals the total frequency

BASIC IDEAS - contents One roll of a dice or a toss of a coin is called a trial , and the outcome of a trial is called an event .

When a dice is rolled, there are six possible outcomes in a single trial - the numbers from 1 to 6.

If we are interested in the chance or probability of getting a 3, for example, then the 3 is called the favourable outcome .



We define the probability of a particular event occurring in a trial as:



We usually let P = probability, so for example, P(3) means the probability of getting a 3 in a single roll of a dice:



We describe this as a probability of 'one in six'.

Note - as in the above case, it sometimes helps to list all possible outcomes and then circle the favourable ones - then the above definition can be used directly.

Example

What is the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed once?





Probabilities can be expressed a fractions, decimals or percentages, so:

P(head) = 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%.

Example

What is the probability of getting the jack of hearts when one card is drawn from a pack of cards?

A pack of cards has 4 suits, with 13 cards in each suit (1 to 10, plus jack, queen, king):





Example

What's the probability of getting a jack of any suit when one card is drawn from a pack?



This time there are 4 favourable outcomes, i.e. any of the jacks in the pack, so:





* * *





RANGE OF PROBABILITIES - start of this chapter - contents





Thus, something that is certain to occur has a probability of one (or, equivalently, 100%)





Thus, something that cannot occur has a probability of zero





So, if a calculation produces a probability greater than 1 or less than zero (negative) then a mistake has been made somewhere.We can represent the range of probabilities as:





* * *





TOTAL PROBABILITY - start of this chapter - contents As already seen, when a dice is rolled, P(3) = 1/6.



What is the probability of not getting a 3?



If we do not get a 3 , then we must get a 1 or 2 or 4 or 5 or 6, so:



Getting a 3 when rolling a dice or not getting a 3 are called complementary events - if one does not occur then the other must. Hence, the probability of one or the other occurring is 1, i.e. certainty.

So, for complementary events:



(Note - there is nothing special about using 3 in the above - any number on the dice could be used)

Example

What is the probability of not drawing a heart when a card is drawn from a pack?

Drawing a heart or not drawing a heart are complementary event - one or the other must occur, so:

P(heart) + P(not a heart) = 1

So, P(not a heart) = 1 - P( heart)





* * *





MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EVENTS - THE ADDITION LAW - start of this chapter - contents What is the probability of getting a 3 or a 5 in a single roll of a dice?





Now, rolling a dice cannot produce both a 3 and a 5 at the same time. Similarly, tossing a coin cannot produce both a head and a tail at the same time. These are said to be mutually exclusive events :





Mutually exclusive events are those which cannot occur together - if one event occurs, the other(s) cannot





We see in the above calculation, that to find the probability of a 3 OR a 5 we ADD the probability of a 3 to the probability of a 5. This is a general rule for mutually exclusive events:



If the individual probabilities of several mutually exclusive events are P1 , P2 , P3 , ... etc., then the probability P of one or other occurring is given by the addition law of probability :





Example A card is drawn from a pack of cards. What is the probability that the card will be a 4 or the king of hearts?

We can firstly do this as before, by listing all possible outcomes, and counting the favourable ones:





Using the addition law we get:



Memory jogger :

MEAL = M utually E xclusive - A ddition L aw





The above may help you avoid mixing up the addition law with the following law.



* * *





INDEPENDENT EVENTS - THE MULTIPLICATION LAW - start of this chapter - contents What is the probability getting a head when a coin is tossed, and getting a 4 when a dice is rolled?

When there are two separate events, we can represent the possible outcomes using a grid:





Crosses have been used to highlight the favourable coin outcomes (H) and circles for the favourable dice outcomes (4).The combined favourable outcome (H and 4) occurs only once, out of 12 possible outcomes, so:



Now, the result of tossing a coin does not influence the result of rolling a dice. These are said to be independent events :





Independent events are those which have no influence on each other





We see in the above calculation, that to find the probability of a Head AND a 4 that we MULTIPLY the probability of a Head by the probability of a 4. This is a general rule for independent events:



If the individual probabilities of several independent events are P1 , P2 , P3 , ... etc., then the probability P all the events occurring is given by the multiplication law of probability :





Example What is the probability of rolling a 3 with a dice and drawing a jack from a pack of cards?

These are independent events, and:



Example

What is the probability of rolling a 3 and then a 4 with a dice.

These are independent events and each has a probability of 1/6.



Again, we can work out the answer using the basic definition of probability. We need to work out all possible outcomes and identify the favourable ones:





There are 6*6 = 36 possible results and only one of them has 3 on the first roll and 4 on the second roll, so the probability is 1/36.



* * *





PROBABILITY TREE - start of this chapter - contents The following represents tossing a coin three times. On the first toss, we may get a head (H) or a tail (T). After either of these we may then get a head or a tail, and after each of these another head or a tail. There are eight different possible sequences of heads and tails:



Notice that: we write the probability of each individual event on each branch

the sum of probabilities on branches coming from the same point equals one (=½ + ½ in all the above cases) - this is because on each toss of a coin the possible outcomes are complementary, i.e. a head or a tail must occur





This above type of diagram is called a probability tree .Each sequence, such as HHH, is a combined event, made up of 3 successive outcomes, and there are 8 such sequences in all.

Now, the result of a toss of a coin is independent of any previous results, so if we follow one sequence such as HHH, to work out its probability, we apply the multiplication law . So:





P(HHH) = P(H) * P(H) * P(H) = ½ * ½ * ½ = 1/8

P(HHT) = P(H) * P(H) * P(T) = ½ * ½ * ½ = 1/8 etc.





Also, if we flip a coin three times, only one of the above combined outcomes can occur. We could get HHH or HHT or HTH etc. So, the eight combined outcomes are mutually exclusive , and so to find the probability of one or other occurring we use the addition law :For example, what is the probability of getting only one tail?

There are three routes that contain only one tail: HHT HTH THH

So, there are 3 favourable routes out of 8 possible routes, each with a probability of 1/8, so the probability of one of them occurring is 3/8





* * *





EXPERIMENTAL PROBABILITY - start of this chapter - contents Sometimes probabilities are based on actual observations, and cannot be worked out theoretically, but we can still use the basic definition of probability.

Suppose that in testing light bulbs, on average 5 in 100 were found to be faulty. If one bulb is selected at random from a box, what is the probability of it being faulty?



The answer is not exact in the way that P(head) = 0.5 was for a coin. We may actually find, for example, that there are 4 faulty bulbs in one batch of 100 bulbs and 6 in another batch.

Note that we still use the term 'favourable outcome' in the calculation, even though we may not think it 'favourable' to select a faulty bulb. The term 'favourable outcome' just refers to how many ways a particular outcome can occur.

Example

When Bob drives to work each day he passes two sets of traffic lights controlled by workmen. The lights are either red (for 'stop') or green (for 'go'). The following are the probabilities that the lights are on red:





Lights 1, probability of red = 2/10

Lights 2, probability of red = 7/10





(i) What is the probability that Bob will have to stop at both sets of lights?

(ii) What is the probability that he will not have to stop at either set?

(iii) What is the probability that he will only have to stop at one set?The probability of having to stop at Lights 1 = 2/10 = 0.2

So, the probability of not having to stop at Lights 1 = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

The probability of having to stop at Lights 2 = 7/10 = 0.7

So, the probability of not having to stop at Lights 2 = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3





(i) The probability of Bob having to stop at both sets of lights (the red-red sequence)



= 0.2*0.7 = 0.14





(ii) The probability that he will not have to stop at either set of lights (the green-green sequence)



= 0.8*0.3 = 0.24





(iii) The probability that he will only have to stop at one set (the red-green or green-red sequence)



= (0.2*0.3) + (0.8*0.7) = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62





Notice that the total probability = 0.14 + 0.24 + 0.62 = 1, since one of them must occur.



* * *





CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY - start of this chapter - contents This sort of probability arises when the probability of one outcome depends on a previous outcome. The multiplication law of probabilities can be applied to successive events, but the various individual probabilities need to be worked out first - using a probability tree can be helpful, as indicated next.

Example

Matthew leaves his jacket over a chair with sweets in the pockets:





the left-hand pocket contains 7 blue and 3 red sweets

the right-hand pocket contains 3 blue and 6 red sweets





Matthew's brother Ryan takes one sweet at random from the left pocket and puts it in the right pocket.If Matthew later takes a sweet from his right pocket, what is the probability of him getting a blue sweet?

We have to consider the effect of Ryan moving a red or a blue sweet from the left to the right pocket:





if Ryan took a blue sweet from the left pocket and put in the right pocket, there are then 4 blue and 6 red sweets in the right pocket

if Ryan took a red sweet from the left pocket and put in the right pocket, there are then 3 blue and 7 red sweets in the right pocket





We can represent all the possible events with a probability tree:

We are interested in the routes (i.e. sequences of events) that end in blue, which are the first and the third from the top.

As we follow any one of the four possible routes, we multiply their probabilities:

For the top route, P(blue, blue) = 7/10*4/10 = 28/100 =0.28

For the third route, P(red, blue) = 3/10*3/10 = 9/100 = 0.09

Only one of the four routes can occur, so the routes are mutually exclusive, and so we add their probabilities:





the probability of Matthew taking a blue sweet from his right pocket = 0.28 + 0.09 = 0.37





Note: Work out the probabilities for the other two routes - if you add all four together you should get 1.
