E A R T H Q U A K E S A N D V O L C A N O E S ( 1 ) Earthquakes

Both earthquakes and volcanoes can be explained by the theory of plate tectonics. The earth’s crust consists of a series of plates. There are seven main plates and many smaller ones. Some plates consist of continental crust others are made of largely oceanic crust.

Convectional activity causes the plates to move. The edges of plates are called plate margins. There are three types of plate margins. At a destructive boundary the plates move together, but at a constructive boundary the plates move apart. At a conservative boundary the plates move side by side.

Seismic waves, as a result of plate movement, cause earthquakes.

The focus of an earthquake is a fault deep in the earth’s crust. The shock waves move out from the focus and reach the earth’s surface at the epicentre. Most earthquakes occur along plate margins.

The effect of an earthquake can be measured on the Richter or Mercalli scales. The Richter scale measures the strength on a scale of 1–10. An earthquake measuring 7 on the Richter scale is 100

times stronger than one measuring 5. The Mercalli scale measures the physical effects of an earthquake on a scale of 1–12.

LEDCs suffer the greatest loss of life from earthquakes. This is because buildings are not as strong and emergency services are not as efficient. The economic cost of earthquakes can be greater in MEDCs as the economic life of a MEDC suffers greater disruption.

There have been many attempts to reduce the effects of earthquakes. More accurate forecasting of earthquakes allows earlier evacuation. Use of cross bracing and installing rubber shock absorbers in foundations make buildings more resistant to shock.

E A R T H Q U A K E S A N D V O L C A N O E S ( 3 ) Volcanoes

Volcanoes occur where there is a weakness in the earth’s crust.

This allows magma to move to the surface where it forms lava. An active volcano is one that has erupted in living memory. A dormant volcano is one that last erupted in historical times. It can never be assumed that a volcano is extinct.

Mount Pinatubo in the Phillipines erupted violently in 1991 having been dormant for 600 years.

Magma can also bubble up to the earth’s surface through fissures or cracks, which eventually forms lava plateaux.

E A R T H Q U A K E S A N D V O L C A N O E S ( 4 ) The build up of material from a series of eruptions forms a volcanic cone. The shape of the cone depends on the type of material and the chemical composition of the lava. Viscous lava forms a steep sided cone. Thin, non-viscous lava produces a low-angle, shield volcano. Many cones are composite as they consist of layers of ash and lava.

Other volcanic hazards include nueés ardents, which are superheated clouds of gas and dust, lahars, which are mudflows, as well as ash, pumice and toxic gas.

Despite the danger people still live close to volcanoes. Volcanic soils are very fertile. Tourists like to see volcanic hot springs, geysers and boiling mud. Geothermal energy produces electricity.

Precious stones and minerals are often found in extinct volcanoes.

R O C K S A N D L A N D F O R M S ( 1 ) Types of rocks

Rocks can be divided into three main groups: igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic. Igneous rocks are formed as molten magma deep in the earth’s crust. They cool slowly and solidify underground.

They are very resistant to erosion. Most sedimentary rocks consist of mineral particles formed by the breakdown of older rocks.

Limestone, chalk and coal are sedimentary rocks formed from the fossilised remains of animals and plants. Metamorphic rocks have been changed as the result of heat, pressure or chemical reactions.

R O C K S A N D L A N D F O R M S ( 2 ) Igneous and metamorphic rocks are found largely in the north and west of the British Isles to the north and west of the Tees–Exe line. Most of the south and east of the Isles is made up of sedimentary rocks.

Weathering

Erosion and weathering both result in the breakdown of rocks.

Erosion involves movement whereas weathering takes place ‘in situ’. The material that has been broken down by weathering and erosion is removed by mass movement. This reveals a fresh rock face to attack from the elements. Weathered and eroded material will form scree at the bottom of a slope.

There are two main types of weathering: physical and chemical. In high mountains and high latitudes most physical weathering is by freeze–thaw. When the temperature drops below 0°C water freezes inside cracks in the rocks. The ice can split the rocks. In deserts the large daily range in temperature produces insolation weathering of rocks. Minerals in the rocks expand and contract at different rates setting up internal stresses. The outer rock layers flake off; so-called exfoliation or ‘onion peeling’.

Scree is the accumulation of small rock fragments at the bottom of a slope. On flatter surfaces, especially where rock joints are widely spaced, freeze–thaw breaks up the rocks into massive boulders to form boulder fields.

Chemical weathering is most effective in hot, wet climates.

The most common forms of chemical weathering are solution weathering where rock minerals dissolve in rainwater; oxidation where minerals react with oxygen; and hydration where minerals absorb water. Carbonation causes weathering in carboniferous limestone areas.

R O C K S A N D L A N D F O R M S ( 3 ) Folding and faulting

Distinctive landscapes develop because of the underlying rock type and as a result of folding and faulting.

Massive tectonic movements cause folding and faulting. Folding occurs where rocks bend as a result of pressure. This produces upfolds called anticlines and downfolds called synclines. The Rockies and the Alps are huge, fold mountains. Rigid or brittle rocks fault when under pressure. Rift valleys and fault scarps form as a result of normal and reverse faulting.

Landforms

Igneous rocks develop underground as a result of interior or intrusive vulcanicity. Magma solidifies to form distinctive shapes known as batholiths, dykes and sills.

Dartmoor is an example of a batholith. The granite upland is part of a much larger batholith beneath the earth’s surface. Granite forms rugged uplands, which are poorly drained with large expanses of moorland. Dominant features are tors.

Dykes run across rock strata whereas sills run parallel to them.

Sills often form steep valleys.

P007-12 9/4/01 1:14 pm Page 10

R O C K S A N D L A N D F O R M S ( 4 ) Limestone and chalk are both calcium carbonate. Limestone is permeable but chalk is porous. Acidic rainwater chemically weathers calcium carbonate by carbonation. Karst scenery develops on carboniferous limestone in areas such as the Mendips.

The main features of karst scenery are limestone pavements, swallow holes or sinks, caves, stalactites and stalagmites. There is a lack of surface drainage because of the large number of underground streams and rivers. Escarpments with a steep scarp slope and a gentle dip slope are characteristic of chalk scenery.

There is a lack of surface water with a complex system of dry valleys.

Water constantly cycles between the atmosphere and the earth’s surface, through a series of flows and stores. The main flows are evaporation, precipitation and rivers. Examples of stores are the sea, glaciers and lakes. When precipitation reaches the ground it gets into rivers in three ways: direct flow straight from the atmosphere; surface flow; and flow through permeable rocks and the soil.

The area drained by a river and its tributaries is called a drainage basin or catchment. The boundaries of the river basin or watersheds separate one basin from another.

A river develops distinctive landforms as a result of erosion, transportation, and deposition. The processes of river erosion are corrosion, corrasion, hydraulic action and attrition. A river’s load is transported by solution, suspension, saltation and traction depending on the size of material.

Transportation of a

river’s load

A river’s long profile or talweg and its cross section change from the river’s source to its mouth. Moving downstream there is a decrease in the river’s gradient, an increase in water volume and an increase in the amount of sediment carried by the river. These result in different processes and landforms developing in the river’s upper, middle and lower courses.

Landforms in the upper course form by erosion mainly. Potholing results in a V-shaped cross section. Waterfalls retreat upstream leaving a gorge as the result of headward erosion. The river is small and inefficient so it is easily deflected by obstacles in its path.

This forms interlocking spurs.

In the middle course the river begins to erode sideways or laterally.

Meanders begin to form. The faster currents on the outside of river bends undercut the bank forming river cliffs. Deposition takes place on slip-off slopes found on the inside of meanders where the current is slower. The cross section becomes asymmetrical.

Main features of a river’s middle course The main features of the lower course are a broad, shallow flood plain, with ox-bow lakes and levées. The river enters the sea through an estuary or a delta. Deltas occur where a river splits into a series of distributaries. This happens if the river flows into a sea where there are no strong tides or currents, or if the river is carrying large amounts of sediment.

Flooding

Rivers flood when their discharge or flow is greater than the channel can cope with. This often occurs when there is a large increase in precipitation or during a spring snow melt. The river regime shows the seasonal variations in a river’s flow. The link between precipitation and discharge is shown in a flood hydrograph.

Flood hydrograph

Flooding is more likely when precipitation is heavy and intense. If the soil is saturated water will run off quickly into rivers. Flooding is less likely if the main rock types are porous or permeable.

Human actions can increase flood danger. Flood plains have dense populations because the fertile alluvial soils are good for farming and the river can be used for irrigation. The flat land encourages industry and settlement. The building of roads and houses increases surface run-off. Deforestation also increases surface run-off.

The impact of floods can be reduced by flood preventative measures. These minimise run-off and use reservoirs to store excess water. Flood water can be confined to rivers by embankments and relief channels. Excess water can be removed by increasing the flow rate. For example by widening, deepening and straightening the river channel.

Human activities

The most effective management of rivers is by a whole-basin approach. In addition to flood control measures, irrigation and navigation can be improved. Dams and reservoirs can be used to generate hydroelectricity as well as providing opportunities for recreation and leisure.

The upper parts of a river basin are used for sheep farming, quarrying and water storage. High precipitation and narrow valleys are suitable for dam and reservoir construction. The slopes of the valleys can be forested. There are greater opportunities for agriculture and industry further downstream. Estuaries are favourable sites for industry as they allow import and export facilities and the flat land is suitable for building. Often there are large areas of mud that can be reclaimed and used for large industrial sites.

There are two main forms of glaciation. Highland or valley glaciation is where ice forms glaciers which flow along valleys. In lowland or continental glaciation an ice sheet covers a whole area. Highland glaciation is taking place still in mountainous areas such as the Alps and the Rockies. Antarctica is an area of continental glaciation.

The Ice Age ended 10,000 years ago. The Lake District and the Scottish Highlands show the effects of highland glaciation. East Anglia’s landscape is dominated by lowland glaciation features.

Glacial erosion is the result of a combination of two processes: frost shattering and abrasion. Water freezes in cracks in the rocks, expands and shatters the rock. Rock fragments stick to the underside of the ice by plucking. As the ice moves it acts like a giant file.

Glacial landforms

A corrie is an armchair shaped circular depression with steep walls on three sides. At the front a rock lip can dam water to form a tarn lake. Semi-rotational movement of the ice has enlarged and deepened an existing depression in the mountain. Arêtes and pyramidal peaks develop where several corries occur back to back.

Glaciers are ice flows which start in corries and move down existing river valleys. This creates a U-shaped glacial trough with truncated spurs. The U-shaped valley is straighter and deeper.

Ribbon or finger lakes form in a glacial trough either by a glacier overdeepening part of the valley floor or by moraine blocking the end of a valley.

Glaciated highlands have a variety of uses. Their spectacular scenery attracts tourists in both summer and winter. U-shaped and hanging valleys are ideal for HEP stations. Ribbon lakes are natural reservoirs. Artificial reservoirs are built by damming the valleys.

Sheep farming is the main type of agriculture. In some areas there is conflict between the various landuses which can cause environmental damage.

Glacial deposits

Glacial deposition forms moraines. Unlike river deposits they are unsorted. A moraine will have a mixture of deposits ranging in size from large boulders to the finest rock flour. Terminal (end), lateral and medial moraines are named after the positions they are found in.

Types of moraine

Material carried underneath the ice is left as ground moraine.

The weight of the ice crushes the material to form boulder clay.

This is deposited as a continuous till plain or as a series of egg shaped drumlins.

Erratics are rocks that have been transported by ice and deposited in an area of very different geology. Roches mountonnées have a gentle up-valley slope formed by abrasion. Plucking causes the down-valley side to be steeper. A crag and tail forms when a resistant plug, e.g. a volcanic cone, protects the material being eroded behind by the ice. In this case the gentler slope is on the down-valley side.

Meltwater streams flow within, below and in front of the ice. These transport material and deposit them as fluvial–glacial deposits.

These form kames, kame terraces, eskers and outwash plains.

Physical geography of Denmark

Boulder clay or till plains in Denmark and East Anglia are important arable farming areas. The glacial deposits are not too sticky when wet and are good for growing crops. Other moraines do not produce particularly fertile conditions because of their unsorted nature.

Wave action

The sea erodes, transports and deposits by wave action. Waves are formed by the wind. When waves reach shallower water, friction with the sea bed slows down the bottom of the waves. The wave increases in height until it breaks or plunges. The water runs up the beach to form the swash. The backwash is the water that runs back down the beach. There is less frictional loss of energy where the offshore gradient is steep.

Waves in shallow water

Constructive waves have a strong swash and a weaker backwash.

These are more likely to deposit material on the coast. The backwash of a destructive wave is stronger than its swash.

Destructive waves erode material from the coast. The most powerful waves are caused by strong winds which blow continuously over a long fetch.

Erosion by the sea is the result of a number of processes: abrasion or corrasion; corrosion or solution hydraulic action and attrition.

These are most effective where the coast is made up of less resistant rock, such as sands and clays.

Processes of wave erosion

Abrasion/corrasion

Sand and shingle carried by waves scour and grind the rocks along the coastline.

Hydraulic action

The pounding effect of water on the coastline during storms.

Even the hardest rocks can break up as they are loosened along joints and bedding planes.

Corrosion/solution

The dissolving of rocks by sea water.

Attrition

The wearing away and rounding of sediments (to form sand and shingle) by abrasion and by rubbing against each other.

Coastal features

On an accordant coast the strata of the rocks lie parallel to the coast giving it a very smooth outline.

On a discordant coast the rock strata are at right angles to the coast allowing differential erosion to occur. This results in the formation of a series of headlands and bays. Headlands are left when wave action forms bays in areas of less resistant rock. Wave action erodes weaker parts of headlands too. This can result in the formation of caves, arches and stacks.

Wave action forms a notch at the base of a cliff. This undercutting causes the cliff to collapse. As this cycle repeats over time the cliffs retreat inland. The cliffs get higher and steeper. A wave-cut platform forms at the base of the cliff. This is covered with beach deposits which are transported from the cliff face and eventually deposited in the sea.

Beaches are accumulations of wave deposits. Some of this material comes from cliff erosion. The rest is transported by rivers or along the coast by wave action. Material is transported along the coast in a zig-zag movement called longshore drift. The swash runs up the beach at an angle but the backwash runs straight back down the beach.

There are several types of wave depositional features. There are spits, tombolos, barrier beaches and bay head beaches. Spits are ridges of sand or shingle that are joined to the mainland at one end. Waves cannot reach the water behind the spit. This allows tidal currents to deposit material which form mud flats and salt marshes. A barrier beach or bar is joined at both ends. A tombolo joins an island to the mainland.

Coastal areas are affected by changes in sea level. If the sea rises or falls the effects are felt worldwide. If land moves then the effects are more localised. If sea level rises, the coast is submerged and rias, estuaries or fjords can form. A fall in sea level forms an emergent coastline with a series of raised beaches above the new sea level.

Coastal management

Coastal areas need to be managed because both physical and human factors affect them. Coastal erosion can have disastrous effects on people living close to the sea. Sea walls, gabions, revetments and groynes defend the coast from wave attack.

Global warming is likely to increase the rate of coastal erosion.

Some argue that it will become too expensive to defend the coast.

Methods of coastal protection

Tourism is very important in coastal areas. Trampling over sand dunes destroys vegetation and exposes the dunes to wind erosion.

Sun-tan lotion and boat oil can cause pollution. Careful planning is required to protect the environment.

W E A T H E R A N D C L I M A T E ( 1 ) Weather is the day-to-day variations of temperature, precipitation, sunshine, wind and atmospheric pressure. Climate is the seasonal average of the weather based on records kept for a minimum of 35 years.

The location of a place determines its climate. Temperature generally decreases with latitude because the sun’s rays are concentrated in smaller areas closer to the Equator. The rays have to pass through less atmosphere too. Temperatures are also affected by variations in the length of day and night.

Temperatures fall on average 6.5 °C for every 1,000 m altitude.

The further a place is from the sea the more extreme or continental its climate (e.g. Kiev). The location will have a greater range of temperature. This is because of the effect of the sea which warms up slowly in the summer and cools less quickly in winter.

Precipitation decreases with increasing distance from the sea.

An inland location is more likely to have a summer maximum of precipitation. Places near the sea have a maritime climate.

The British Isles have a cool temperate maritime climate. The western parts are wetter than the east because prevailing winds blow from the west off the Atlantic Ocean. The winds rise over the higher land in the west of Britain, then cool and condense to produce precipitation. The east is in a rain shadow.

In winter the isotherms run north to south with the warmest areas being in the west. The Atlantic Ocean and the North Atlantic Drift, a warm ocean current, are responsible for this. In summer the south of Britain is warmer than the north because of the effect of latitude on isotherms.

W E A T H E R A N D C L I M A T E ( 3 ) Precipitation is caused by moist air rising, which makes water vapour cool and condense. Relief or orographic rainfall forms when air is forced to rise over mountains. Frontal or cyclonic rain occurs where warm air rises over cold air. High temperatures can result in convectional rainfall.

Depressions are areas of low pressure which develop along the Polar Front. Winds blow anticlockwise into the centre of a depression. Fronts separate cold air from warm air. Steady rain develops at a warm front. Heavier rain, sometimes with thunder and lightening, marks the passing of a cold front.

Anticyclones are areas of high pressure. The isobars are widely spaced so conditions are usually calm. Any winds blow in a clockwise direction. In winter anticyclones can bring foggy weather or very bright conditions with sharp frosts. In summer anticyclones bring sunny conditions with above average temperatures.

Weather forecasting relies on satellite images as well as weather charts. Satellites can transmit both visible and infra-red images in black and white.

W E A T H E R A N D C L I M A T E ( 4 ) Extreme weather conditions present serious hazards to people. These may be short term or long term. Weather can cause massive damage to property, crops and livestock as well as loss of life. The impact of extreme weather conditions is greatest in poorer countries.

Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones are violent tropical storms.

They are areas of extreme low pressure which develop over warm seas. Very strong winds, cloud and heavy precipitation accompanied by sea surges are features of these storms.

The tropical rainforest is an important ecosystem. Rainforests occur in the Equatorial lowlands, in the Amazonian and Zaire basins, and in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. The rainforests have enormous biomass and biodiversity. A year long growing season with a constant temperature of 25–30 °C and rainfall of 1,500 –5,000 mm per year provide ideal growing conditions.

The rainforest has a definite structure. Emergents reach 50 metres height, with the main canopy reaching about 35 metres. There is relatively little undergrowth, apart from flowering plants, grasses and ferns. Lianas and epiphytes hang from trees. There are many different species, but they do not occur in pure strands. The trees are deciduous but the forest always appears green.

T H E E C O S Y S T E M C O N C E P T ( 3 ) Mediterrranean vegetation

Mediterranean climate is found on the western sides of continents between 30 ° and 40 ° North and South, e.g. southern Europe, central Chile, South Africa, south and west Australia, and the north island of New Zealand. Summers are hot and dry, with an average temperature of 25–30 °C. Winters are mild and wet with temperatures averaging 8–12 °C.

The natural forest vegetation of Mediterranean areas has been replaced by humans. The vegetation is mainly scrub called garrigue, chapparel or macquis. This consists of sweet smelling plants such as gorse, heather, rosemary and lavender. The vegetation has developed characteristics which allow it to survive the long summer drought. Long roots tap underground water, and the thick waxy leaves reduce transpiration. Bulbs and tubers flower in spring when there is still moisture. Cacti store water in the plant tissue.

Coniferous forest

The areas of northern Canada, Scandinavia and Russia between 50 and 66 °N are covered with coniferous forest (taiga). The forest is dominated by conifers such as pine, spruce, fir and larch. They are the world’s main source of softwood. Most countries in these areas have developed a sustainable management plan for their timber resources and have an active replanting programme.

The trees can survive the extreme climate. The growing season is short with six months below freezing. The total precipitation is low, mainly falling in the summer. Most of the precipitation is ‘locked up’ in snow. The vegetation has adapted to this climate. Conifers keep their leaves all the year around and photosynthesise as soon as the temperature reaches 6 °C. The needle shaped leaves reduce moisture loss. The cone shaped nature of the trees allows snow to slip off easily without damaging the leaves.

P O P U L A T I O N D I S T R I B U T I O N ( 1 ) Population density

Population density is the number of people per unit area. It is calculated by dividing the total population by the area. The average population density of the world is low. The global pattern of population density is very uneven. Around 20% of the world’s population lives in less than 10% of the land.

Physical factors determine population distribution. Climate is an important factor. There tends to be denser population where climate favours agriculture. Very dry and cold areas can support only a sparse population. Outside the Tropics mountains are sparsely populated. Fertile soils and water encourage high population densities. Inaccessibility makes rainforests sparsely populated.

Human factors can attract population to inhospitable areas such as deserts, e.g. mineral exploitation. Population is greater in highly industrialised regions. Dense population can be supported by technologically advanced societies. The regions of highest population density tend to be those which have the longest history of settlement.

Birth and death rates

The world population is growing at an ever increasing rate. This is likely to continue until 2050. Population change is the number of births minus the number of deaths plus or minus the number of people migrating. The difference between the crude birth rate and the crude death rate is the rate of natural increase.

MEDCs have gone through four distinct stages of population change. This is called the demographic transition. It is not clear whether LEDCs will follow the same pattern.

Birth rates are highest in LEDCs, averaging 28 per 1,000 compared with 12 per 1,000 in MEDCs. Death rates vary more than birth rates.

In LEDCs they vary from 5 to 20 per 1,000. In MEDCs the average is about 10 per 1,000.

The birth rate is higher where there is a high proportion of women of reproductive age (15–49). High infant mortality rates encourage parents to have more children. The knowledge and use of contraception affects birth rate. Birth rates remain high if children are needed to work in agriculture or to look after their parents in old age. Birth control programmes can be important.

Death rates increase where there is a larger proportion of older people. Poor diet, housing conditions and healthcare can increase the death rate. Constant pregnancies can increase the death rate among women. In MEDCs modern living can increase the risk of death from cancer, heart disease and traffic accidents.

P O P U L A T I O N D I S T R I B U T I O N ( 3 ) Population structure

Population structure can be shown on an age–sex pyramid.

Births, deaths and migration patterns can affect the shape of the pyramid. The population pyramid for a LEDC has a broad base and steeply sloping sides. This shows the young nature of the population because of the high birth rate. The steep sides reflect the high infant mortality rate and the low life expectancy. The pyramid for a MEDC has a narrow base and straight sides. Low birth rates over a long period mean that there are relatively few young people. Death rates are high only in extreme old age.

P O P U L A T I O N D I S T R I B U T I O N ( 4 ) The structure of a country’s population has an important effect in future years. In an LEDC the youthfulness of the population means that there will be a large number of potential parents. This can keep the birth rate high. Unless the birth rate falls a decline in infant mortality will increase the width of the pyramid base. The country will then experience an ever increasing rate of population growth.

Countries such as Bangladesh have set up government birth control programmes. The age of marriage has been raised and contraceptive education is more widely available. The education of women has been encouraged. The higher the level of female literacy the lower the birth rate tends to be.

In MEDCs higher living standards and better healthcare have increased life expectancy. There is an increased need for state pensions and a greater pressure on medical and welfare services.

This puts pressure on the working population to support the increasing proportion of older people, e.g. tax raises. In both LEDCs and MEDCs there is an increasing dependency population.

Migration is a movement of people which involves a permanent or semi-permanent change of residence. Emigrants leave a country.

Immigrants enter a country. In LEDCs most people move from rural to urban areas. In MEDCs migration is often the other way around.

Some people move of their own free will. Refugees are migrants who are forced to move.

Push–pull factors

Migration occurs for many different reasons. People moving for a new job or for a better standard of living are economic migrants.

Moving to join other members of the family or to get better medical, welfare or educational facilities are social reasons for migration. Refugees migrate because of political reasons, e.g. persecution, or because of environmental disasters.

Migration can be explained by push and pull factors. Push factors are the disadvantages of a migrant’s existing home. Pull factors are attractions of the new location. There are obstacles to migration such as the cost of moving or family connections.

Lee’s model of migration

Young adults between the ages of 15–40 who are better educated are most likely to migrate. In South America women are most likely to migrate, whereas in Africa a typical migrant is male.

Migration in LEDCs

Rural–urban migration in LEDCs has caused rapid urbanisation.

Farming in rural areas is often unprofitable and the countryside frequently suffers drought and flooding. Medical facilities are poorer in rural areas and infant mortality is often quite high.

Malnutrition is common too. In urban areas there is a greater range of services and greater opportunities for paid employment.

Rural–urban migration in LEDCs has led to the growth of shanty towns in urban areas. The rapidly increasing urban population puts great pressure on housing and services. The migrants provide industry with cheap labour. The rural areas suffer because of the subsequent fall in birth rate and food production. They gain some benefit from the money sent back by migrants living in urban areas.

Migration in MEDCs

Migration in MEDCs is largely urban–rural. This shift is called counterurbanisation. Rural areas experience a net migrational gain, whereas urban areas, particularly large conurbations suffer a net migrational loss. In the UK in addition to counterurbanisation there has been migration from North to South.

Counterurbanisation is the result of three factors. More people own cars. This allows people to live in rural areas but commute to work in urban areas. Many people think that rural areas offer a better quality of life, with less pollution, traffic congestion and lower levels of crime. Increasing numbers of people are moving to the countryside and coastal areas when they retire.

International migration

Population movement between countries is called international migration, e.g. from Caribbean countries and the Indian sub-continent to the UK. This is less common than internal migration because of the distances involved and political restrictions. There is a lot of illegal migration between poor and rich countries, e.g. between Mexico and the USA.

In the mid 1990s there were about 50 million refugees, half of whom were forced to leave their country. The vast majority of these refugees were in LEDCs. Most refugees are victims of war, or ethnic and religious tensions. Other important factors are food shortages and natural disasters.

Migration brings advantages and disadvantages to both the sending and the receiving countries. The movement of people from LEDCs may reduce population pressure. However, the countries may lose the better educated or more skilled people. Migration also produces an unbalanced population structure. The MEDCs obtain cheaper labour and increased knowledge of new cultures and foods. However, racial tension can develop as migrants compete with the native population for jobs.

S E T T L E M E N T PA T T E R N S ( 1 ) There are two types of settlements: rural and urban. Rural settlements have a number of characteristics that make them different from urban settlements. The former are usually smaller, with fewer shops and services. Rural settlements have a lower population density, and a larger percentage of the population works in farming, forestry, quarrying, etc.

A settlement pattern describes the distribution of rural settlements across an area. Physical geography tends to cause an irregular distribution, as settlements usually cluster in areas with more favourable resources. A dispersed settlement pattern consists of isolated farms and/or small hamlets. In a nucleated pattern there are a number of villages.

Site and situation

An individual settlement’s location can be described in terms of its situation and site. The situation of a settlement is its position in relation to the surrounding area. The site is the actual land on which a settlement is built. The site is described in terms of the physical geography on which the settlement stands. The earliest advantages of a particular site are those thought to be important to early settlers. Anglo-Saxon farmers looked for good access to farmland, a water source and nearby woods (for fuel and construction).

Important sites are wet points and dry points. A dry-point site is a higher, and therefore drier, location in an otherwise wet or marshy area. A wet-point site is a source of water where there is little surface drainage. Spring-line settlements develop where impervious rock (e.g. clay) meets pervious rock (e.g. limestone).

Form and function

The functions of a settlement are its economic and social activities.

The functions of most rural settlements were originally agriculture, mining or fishing. Over time their functions have changed. The main function of some rural settlements is tourism now. Many have developed into commuter or dormitory settlements.

Factors influencing the sites and distribution of settlement The shape or form of a settlement refers to the plan outline of its built-up area. Settlements may be linear (ribbon-like), rectangular, circular or star-shaped. Transport routes and flat land encourage growth in a particular direction in certain directions. Planning controls and flood-prone valleys may restrict development in certain directions. These positive and negative factors influence the shape of the settlement.

It is possible to recognise the functions of settlements from Ordnance Survey (OS) maps. These functions include housing, industry, commerce, administration, recreation and transport.

S E T T L E M E N T PA T T E R N S ( 3 ) Settlement hierarchy

Settlement patterns are largely determined by physical geography.

A regular pattern of settlement would occur only on a flat, featureless plain where the population is evenly distributed. Human geographical factors can produce a regular settlement pattern so long as physical geography does not inhibit this. A settlement hierarchy tends to develop in an area. The hierarchy is ranked in order according to certain criteria. This is usually population size, but other factors, such as the number and types of shops and services, can also be used to order settlements.

Settlement hierarchy order

The distribution of settlements can be explained in terms of range, threshold and sphere of influence. The range of a settlement is the maximum distance that a person is prepared to travel to use its services. The threshold represents the minimum area that a settlement can serve, if the shops and services are to remain profitable. The sphere of influence is the area served by the settlement. The arrangement of settlements based on these factors is explained by central place theory.

Settlement pattern according to central place theory Convenience or low order services are found at the bottom of the settlement hierarchy. People use these services regularly, so they are not prepared to travel very far for them. Convenience goods have a small sphere of influence and are found in many small rural settlements. In contrast, people buy comparison goods such as clothes and furniture less often. People are prepared to travel further to purchase these goods. Shops selling comparison goods have to serve a wider area in order to reach their threshold. The shops are found in high order centres such as towns and cities.

They serve the population of the town in which they are located and people living in the surrounding area. There will be fewer higher order settlements and they will be further apart.

Urbanisation

Urban growth is the increase in size of built-up areas in towns and cities. Urbanisation is the increase in the proportion of people living in towns and cities. Urbanisation is greatest in the LEDCs.

This has led to the development of millionaire and megacities.

In many LEDCs there is a primate pattern with one city many times larger than the second largest city. Urbanisation takes place as a result of migration and natural increase. Counterurbanisation has led to the decline of the largest cities in MEDCs.

In many cities in MEDCs there are patterns in the land use, including concentric circles and sectors. In some cities there may be smaller, irregular shaped areas of land, each with its own distinctive land use.

Urban settlement in the UK

The Central Business District (CBD) is the most accessible part of the city as it is the focus of routes. There is a intense competition for space, so land values are high resulting in many multi-storey buildings. Large shops and office blocks dominate these areas. The CBD is relatively small because people there are prepared to walk only short distances to shops. Very few people live in the CBD, as the land is too expensive for housing.

The inner city consists of a twilight zone, which is in decline and contains industry, housing and derelict land. There are areas of high-density housing built in the nineteenth century when industry thrived in urban areas. The suburbs consist of low-density detached and semi-detached housing.

Income, family status, ethnicity and the distribution of housing types affect where people live. Better-off families with children tend to live in the outer suburbs. Inner cities have a higher proportion of disadvantaged people. Ethnic ghettos have developed where immigrants have moved into the inner city.

Inner city problems have proved very difficult to solve. In the 1950s people were moved out to peripheral council estates or to New Towns and Expanded Towns. High-rise flats were unsuccessful.

Since the 1970s urban renewal projects have replaced comprehensive redevelopment. The housing in inner cities is being modernised and the environment improved. This allows people to remain in the inner city and retain their community spirit.

In recent years there has been some migration of more well-off people into the inner city areas. This process of gentrification occurs because these people like to be near where they work and where entertainment takes place.

Urban areas in LEDCs

Cities in LEDCs have a very different land use pattern to those in MEDCs. The CBD is dominated by modern administrative and commercial activities. Better-off people live in modern high-rise apartments around the CBD. Recently arrived migrants from the countryside live in derelict buildings and vacant plots of land close to the CBD where they look for work. The quality of the housing decreases with distance from the city centre. Commercial and industrial areas often follow the main roads and railways out from the city centre.

The rapid growth of cities in LEDCs has produced illegal shanty towns. These are normally found around the edge of the city or on derelict land which is too steep for building or is prone to flooding.

Initially the shanty houses are built with any available materials, such as sacking or corrugated iron. The absence of electricity and running water leads to a high incidence of disease. Inhabitants of shanty towns improve their homes as they become better off.

Governments of LEDCs have tried hard to improve conditions in shanty towns. Cheap, purpose-built flats have been constructed in some cities, even though this encourages yet more people to migrate to the city. Some squatters in shanty towns are given legal status to encourage them to upgrade their homes.

In ‘site and service’ projects families are given a plot of land, served by roads, electricity and water, on which to build a home. Under a

‘self-help scheme’ building materials are provided to improve temporary shacks.

Increasingly it has been recognised that the best way to approach the shanty town problem is to improve conditions in the countryside. It is hoped that this will reduce urbanisation. Urban areas are growing so quickly that they are increasingly unsustainable.

Agriculture can be thought of as a system with inputs, processes and outputs. The system can range from an individual farm up to a regional, national or international scale.

The inputs are physical, economic and political. Agricultural processes happen on a farm. The outputs are products such as crops and livestock. Government grants and subsidies are increasingly important in farming.

Types of agriculture

Farming can be classified as commercial, subsistence, intensive, and extensive.

Subsistence farms produce sufficient outputs only for the farmer’s family and unlike commercial farms they do not produce a surplus for sale. In intensive farming the yields are high because of high inputs of labour, capital or agro-chemicals. Extensive farming produces low output per area, even if output per worker is high. It is practised where land is plentiful and relatively cheap.

and sheep rearing.

Farming distribution in England and Wales, 1995

East Anglia practises commercial arable farming producing wheat, sugar beet, potatoes and other vegetables. The summer temperatures of 15–20 °C encourage ripening. The precipitation is low enough to discourage fungal diseases and the summer maximum swells the crops ready for harvesting. The harsh winters break up the soil and kill pests.

Economies of scale have produced agribusinesses. Farms have merged and field sizes have increased through the removal of hedges. Agro-chemicals are bought in bulk.

South-west England practises dairy farming and market gardening.

The North Atlantic Drift deters frosts. The growing season is long and crops are ready for market earlier than the rest of the UK.

Extensive sheep farming is the most important form of agriculture in the uplands of Wales and Scotland. While many areas still depend on rough grazing, fertiliser use improves much of the pasture. Farming is heavily dependent on subsidies in these areas.

Types of agriculture (cont.)

Shifting agriculture is the traditional farming method in tropical rainforests. It is a form of subsistence farming, often combined with hunting and gathering. Shifting cultivators avoid the problem of poor soils by making temporary forest clearings. Initially crop yields are good. However, cropping and heavy rainfall soon reduce soil fertility, so the farmers move on. Shifting agriculture is sustainable providing the population is not too high.

In semi-arid areas extensive nomadic herding takes place. The quality of the grazing is poor, so animals are moved to new grazing lands following the seasonal rains. Lack of water and poor pasture mean a large area is needed to support each animal.

Intensive horticulture is both labour and capital intensive. High-value crops such as fruit, vegetables and flowers are produced.

There is a reliance on advanced technology and scientific research.

Cooperatives provide growers with credit for materials and expensive machinery. They also help to process and market the products.

Increasingly farming in Europe is dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The success of farming depends as much on CAP as on environmental factors. CAP aims to provide farmers with a guaranteed income. Surplus produce is bought up when prices do not reach a minimum target price. Farming in marginal areas receives grants and subsidies. Money is also available for modernisation, diversification and conservation.

Farmers are paid to ‘set-aside’ land to reduce overproduction Environmental issues

Increased food production has harmed the environment. Hedgerow removal causes wind erosion. Overuse of agro-chemicals has led to eutrophication and contamination of water courses. Biodiversity has been reduced too.

Types of industry

Economic activities can be divided into groups. Primary activities are extraction industries, which produce food and raw materials.

Secondary industries are manufacturing industries, which make added value products, e.g. by refining raw materials; processing materials; or assembling components. Tertiary activities are services.

Quaternary service industries involve high-level decision making.

As a country develops the percentage of people employed in manufacturing increases. In the most developed economies tertiary and quaternary activities are replacing manufacturing industries.

Until the late 1990s the most rapid industrialisation was in the Newly Industrialising Countries (NICs) of South-east Asia.

Factors affecting location

Heavy basic industries have definite site and locational requirements. Modern, lighter industries are footloose. New industrial sites are called greenfield sites. A brownfield site is where a new industry locates on a redeveloped industrial site.

Industrial inertia can affect industrial location.

Traditionally, iron and steel industries were located close to sources of energy or raw materials. Modern iron and steel works rely on imported coal and iron ore, so they have coastal locations. There is no longer bulk storage of coal, iron and limestone at these sites.

A continuous supply of raw materials is brought to the site.

Car manufacturing is an assembly industry. Components such as engines and body parts are assembled together. Transnational companies (TNCs) operate globally and dominate the car industry.

The headquarters of TNCs are usually in a MEDC but the TNC can have factories all over the world. Since 1984 Japanese car companies have invested heavily in the UK. The location of Japanese car plants has been affected heavily by the government location policy in the UK. The policy encourages industry in areas of high unemployment.

High-tech industries are footloose, but most are found close to universities. Universities offer a highly skilled workforce including scientists, technicians and managers, and are centres of research and development. Access to airports is important too, as high-tech industries are global. Easy access to banks and other financial institutions is necessary for raising investment.

Globalisation

Increasingly, manufacturing industry is organised on a global scale.

One effect has been the rapid growth in LEDCs. Globalisation has occurred because TNCs can employ people, make products and buy services cheaply in LEDCs, as well as gaining access to worldwide markets. Globalisation allows economies of scale too. Foreign investors in the UK get around EU trade barriers.

The distribution of manufacturing industry across the world has changed. The nature of industry in traditional coalfield locations is different too. Government location policy and globalisation have produced these changes.

Tourism is leisure time that involves visiting places and staying away from home for at least one night. It is one of the world’s fastest growing industries employing 120 million people. Tourism develops in mountains, coastal areas and cities. The physical attractions of mountains and coasts attract visitors. People visit cities because of their historical and cultural heritage, and for shopping and entertainment.

Tourism has developed because of increased leisure time. People have longer, paid holidays today. Increased car ownership and the development of charter flights have made places more accessible.

UK tourist industry

Tourism first developed in the UK during the second half of the nineteenth century. The introduction of paid holidays, cheap railway travel and effective advertising of the health benefits of sea air encouraged tourism.

Blackpool’s tourism industry took off with the introduction of a railway link to the rapidly growing industrial cities of the North.

More recently, the uncertainty of British weather has caused a decline in British seaside resorts. Blackpool continues to attract tourists by providing new entertainment facilities which are less dependent on the weather.

The development of package holidays benefited foreign holidays because travel companies make all the necessary travel and accommodation arrangements. Economies of scale has meant cheaper holidays for customers.

The USA and the Caribbean are as popular as Mediterranean Europe for holidaymakers. These destinations have made package tourism a year-round industry.

In a few years’ time tourism will be the UK’s biggest industry. It is an important source of income. Over 23 million foreign visitors come to the UK each year spending £12,000 million.

National Parks are areas of great natural beauty that are protected in order to save the environment and to provide enjoyment to visitors.

National Parks in the USA are large areas of wilderness owned by the government. In the UK National Parks are smaller and contain a range of economic activities, as well as tourism. Much of the land is privately owned and there are many permanent settlements.

There is great potential for conflict in National Parks. Problems include traffic congestion, footpath erosion and noise pollution from speedboats on lakes.

Tourism in LEDCs

Although LEDCs account for only 20% of world tourism this proportion is growing rapidly. Tourism is the fastest growing industry in Africa. LEDCs view tourism as a means of development.

The tropical nature of many LEDCs makes them very attractive to visitors from MEDCs.

In many LEDCs tourists are an important source of income. Not only do tourists spend money, but they also attract foreign investment as the country’s infrastructure is improved. The tourist industry creates jobs too. There is also a multiplier effect with the growth of indirect employment, e.g. farmers provide food for hotels.

Tourism also has disadvantages to LEDCs. Improving infrastructure is expensive, so it is often dependent on foreign investment. Much of the profits therefore do not remain in the LEDC. Development tends to be concentrated in holiday areas and can create a dual economy.

Environmental issues

Mass tourism may change local culture and traditions. It also puts enormous pressure on the environment, e.g. pollution. Ugly buildings and resorts may replace vegetation.

In Kenya large areas of land have been designated as game parks to protect wild animals from the effects of mass tourism. Minibuses carrying tourists have worn away tracks, encouraging soil erosion.

The high concentration of visitors and hot air balloon trips have disturbed the breeding patterns and migration routes of some animals. Local farmers have been displaced from their own land.

Green tourism is sustainable. Zimbabwe has similar attractions to Kenya, but it has developed its tourist industry very differently.

Zimbabwe encourages eco-tourists, usually in small groups visiting on special interest holidays. These include wildlife enthusiasts, bird watchers, botanists and photographers.

Game parks have been established but there is support from local people. The CAMPFIRE programme educates local people to regard wild animals as a ‘resource’. Only a limited number of wild animals can be hunted for sport, and the proceeds go to the local population. Local communities receive money for any crop damage caused by wild animals.

Global warming has both advantages and disadvantages. Britain will be able to grow a greater range of crops. Warmer weather may help the tourist industry. However, there will be increased danger of coastal flooding, water shortages, pests and disease. Globally, the melting of the polar ice caps will cause many low-lying areas to flood. Droughts, storms and floods will become more frequent.

At the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil there was a general agreement to reduce the amount of fossil fuels burnt. Rapid industrialisation in NICs, the economic interests of TNCs, and the reluctance of the USA to reduce its living standard means progress has been very slow.

Power stations and oil refineries release sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. These gases react with water in the atmosphere to produce acid rain. Forests, soils, lakes, rivers and buildings in Scandinavia have been badly affected by acid rain produced in the UK and Germany. International cooperation is required to reduce this effect.

M A N A G I N G N A T U R A L R E S O U R C E S ( 3 ) Conserving energy resources

The need to satisfy the increasing demand for energy and water is the primary concern in resource management. Increasing population and the rapid development of technology means that this problem will continue in future. Conservation and sustainability will be major considerations.

In future, fossil fuels will still be needed to produce energy. In the UK

there has been a large reduction in underground coal mining. Open-cast mining is still important because it is cheaper than deep mining.

It also provides jobs in areas of high unemployment. However, it is environmentally destructive. Landscaping can reduce this effect.

Nuclear power requires very little raw material and does not produce greenhouse gases or acid rain. It has become increasingly unpopular because of safety issues. The Chernobyl disaster and concerns about the Sellafield plant in the UK have affected public opinion greatly.

Unlike the UK, France still regards nuclear power as an important source of energy.

Alternative or renewable sources of energy such as wind, tidal, solar, hydro and geothermal power may be the way forward. These too have advantages and disadvantages.

M A N A G I N G N A T U R A L R E S O U R C E S ( 4 ) Water resources

At present, the global demand for water doubles every 25 years.

Reasons are world population growth, increasing use of irrigation and increased consumption per person. This demand is unsustainable.

Just 5% of the rain falling in the UK is used. In recent years water shortages have become common. Global warming may be responsible for these droughts. Most of the rain falls in the north and west of the UK. The largest demand is in the south and east. Rainfall is highest in winter but the greatest demand for water is in the summer.

Satisfying water demand is not easy. As well as maintaining supply, water companies have to ensure supplies are sustainable and do not damage the environment. They can increase water reserves by building more reservoirs. Water can be transferred from areas of plenty to areas of shortage. Conservation measures include plugging leaks and metering water

C O N T R A S T S I N D E V E L O P M E N T ( 1 ) Development is the extent to which a country, region or locality has realised the full potential of its human and physical resources.

Development can reduce poverty and improve quality of life.

Economic development is the expansion of agricultural, manufacturing or service industries. Social development is about providing people with essential services such as education and healthcare.

Measures of development

There are a number of ways of

measuring development. Measures

are average figures only and do not

take account of internal variations.

C O N T R A S T S I N D E V E L O P M E N T ( 2 ) The global distribution of wealth is very uneven. With the exception of Australia and New Zealand all MEDCs are in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. LEDCs are concentrated in the Tropics and the southern hemisphere. It is possible to divide the world into the rich ‘North’ and the poor ‘South’.

Contrasts in development are very marked within countries. Core areas tend to concentrate on manufacturing industry and services.

This creates jobs and attracts investment – the ‘multiplier effect’.

Remoteness, physical disadvantages of relief and climate, and greater reliance on agriculture are features of poorer, peripheral regions. These regions do not attract investment and this can lead to out-migration. Differences between core areas and the periphery tend to increase.

C O N T R A S T S I N D E V E L O P M E N T ( 3 ) Obstacles to development

Globally, the contrast between the rich North and poor South is getting wider. The majority of the world’s countries is still under developed. The obstacles to development are both human and physical.

Landlocked countries are isolated from international trade. Tropical soils are shallow and acidic. Laterisation leads to the build up of iron salts in the surface layers making them difficult to cultivate.

Low precipitation and its seasonal nature make farming difficult.

Dense rainforest hinders development in equatorial regions.

Pests and disease affect the health of people living in LEDCs. The tropical climate and poor living conditions favour the spread of malaria and sleeping sickness - both diseases are carried by mosquitoes and tsetse flies. In LEDCs most people cannot afford essential medicines. Pests destroy up to half of the world’s food crops. Poor food results in famine, malnutrition and disease. Lack of education is responsible for the rapid spread of HIV and AIDS in many LEDCs.

About two billion people have no access to clean water. Polluted streams and pools encourage water-borne diseases, e.g. diarrhoea.

International trade is the movement of goods and services between countries. The things a country sells abroad are its exports. The things it buys from abroad are imports. The difference between a country’s imports and exports is its balance of trade.

There has been a great expansion in world trade. The LEDCs have gained least from this growth. The value of trade in most countries in the poor ‘South’ is less than 1,000 US dollars per head - below 25% of the figure for countries in the rich ‘North’.

Countries try to protect their own economies by imposing tariffs and quotas on foreign imports. The World Trade Organisation aims to promote free trade by removing these restrictions. There are many influences on international trade.

Trading groups such as the EU are set up to promote free trade between its members and to reduce the effectiveness of foreign competition. A lot of the trade between MEDCs and LEDCs is the result of globalisation and the spread of TNCs.

Most trade is between MEDCs. There is an increasing amount of trade between MEDCs and LEDCs, turning primary goods into manufactured goods. Most of the world’s poorest countries rely on the export of primary goods. Converting primary goods to manufactured goods ‘adds value’. Most manufacturing takes place in MEDCs who gain most from the profits and jobs that this creates.

Coffee growers in LEDCs receive less than 33% of the supermarket price for a coffee jar. There are great fluctuations in the price of primary goods. There has been a steady fall in the price of primary goods compared to manufactured goods.

Aid

Aid to LEDCs can be in the form of money, food, equipment and technical assistance. Few MEDCs achieve the UN recommended target of donating 7% of their GNP as foreign aid. The Scandinavians are the most generous donating between 0.83 and 0.92%. The UK gives 0.26% of GNP and the USA just 0.16%.

Short-term aid is sent in response to an emergency, e.g. a natural disaster. The purpose of long-term aid is to improve the quality of people’s lives. Multilateral aid is donated by international bodies such as the World Bank. It is unlikely to have any conditions attached. Bilateral aid is given by one country to another. It may be tied aid, e.g. the

Aid has advantages and disadvantages for both MEDCs and LEDCs.

The advantages to LEDCs are that money and emergency supplies are available at times of disaster. Also, foreign investment helps economic and social development. However, there is a danger that LEDCs become too dependent on aid. This is particularly true for tied aid. An LEDC may not be able to get the best prices for its products. MEDCs gain prestige from donating foreign aid.

Corruption in LEDCs means that a lot of aid does not reach the right people. Aid money may be used to buy military arms.

Interdependence

LEDCs and MEDCs depend on each other. Trade, investment, loans, interest payments, foreign aid and international migration link them.

MEDCs gain from this interdependence. They obtain raw materials and foodstuffs relatively cheaply. Profits from TNCs usually go back to MEDCs. Tied aid boosts exports and secures jobs in MEDCs.

However, cheaper wages and fewer planning restrictions in LEDCs mean that investments by TNCs can cause job loses in MEDCs.

Industrialisation in LEDCs may produce stiff competition to industries in MEDCs.

LEDCs

MEDCs

LEDCs gain hard currency by exporting to MEDCs. LEDCs benefit from investment by TNCs. New jobs are created often educating people in new skills and technologies. The terms of trade often works against LEDCs. Exploitation of primary resources in LEDCs may cause environmental damage.

G E O G R A P H I C A L S K I L L S ( 1 ) GCSE geography examinations will test three main elements; recall of factual knowledge, understanding of concepts and processes, and geographical skills. The coursework component of the examination gives you the best opportunity to show your mastery of skills, but most questions in the written papers will have a skills-based section.

Geographical skills include the drawing and interpretation of graphs, numbers, maps and diagrams. Marks will be given for the accuracy of your drawing, but there will be more marks for description and interpretation. Interpretation questions range from simple extraction of information from stimulus material to description and to analysis and evaluation.

The four major types of graph tested at GCSE are line, bar (or histogram), scatter and pie. If asked to draw any of these it is important to do it accurately. The degree of toleration allowed is quite small. Use a sharp pencil and a ruler.

Use line graphs to plot continuous data, e.g. temperature, population. Plot the points accurately and join them by a continuous line – either freehand or using a ruler.

Use scatter graphs to show the relationship between two sets of figures. On a scatter graph it is the pattern that the points make that it is important, so do not join up the points. If there is a clear pattern do not assume automatically that one feature caused the other. There are examples of scatter graphs on side 3 of Geographical Skills.

There is a wide range of uses for scatter graphs in geography.

Examples include relationships between latitude and temperature; GNP and infant mortality, and application of fertiliser and yield of crops.

Typical scatter graph patterns (or correlations).

In the graphs above there is a positive link in A because one variable increases with the other. In B the link is negative because one variable increases as the other decreases. If the points form a straight line then there is a perfect relationship. This is very unusual. The trend in the points can be shown by a best-fit line (see below). Residuals are obvious exceptions to the trend. In C (above) there is no relationship at all.

Pie chart to show land use in Grange Farm Many GCSE questions start with a map, a diagram or a piece of text

– so-called stimulus material. The question will ask for information contained in this material. Make sure that you extract information accurately. If a key is provided use the precise wording given including any units. For these questions no credit is given for any information that has not been taken from the stimulus material.

A very common skills-based question is to ask for a description of a pattern made by some geographical feature. The question may be based on a map, a graph or a set of figures. The pattern should be considered from the general, the specific and the exceptional point of view. Give the overall trend or picture first, followed by specific details. State any exceptions to the general rule last and comment on them. The graph on side 5 shows how the production of a particular commodity has changed over time.

Production of a commodity over time

Using the general/specific/exceptional rule: From the graph you can tell there has been a general rise in production over the years. The rise has not been steady. There has been a series of small-scale fluctuations which occur every few years. There was a major fall in output during one year.

Atlas maps show patterns using chloropleth maps. The darker the colour the greater the value. Patterns in chloropleths can be described in the same way. Describe the general pattern that strikes you when you first look at a chloropleth map. Then list specific details that support this pattern together with any exceptions.

Merely restating facts and figures does not show the examiner you can appreciate a pattern.

Consider the following question:

Describe the pattern of population change in France between 1976 and 1986.

Population changes in France

A possible answer to the question on the reverse side of this card could be:

In general the areas of greatest population increase are in the north, west and south of the country. The south coast and the region around Nantes experienced population increases between 7.5 and 13.0%. The area of greatest loss was in the centre of France and in the North-east. The most central areas of France and two areas in the North-east, including the area around Lille, have seen a population decline of between 0.5 and 1.5 %. (This describes the general pattern with specific details illustrating the points made.) Exceptions to the general pattern are the areas around Paris and Toulouse, and the area north of Bordeaux where increases of only 3-4.7% are lower than expected. The population changes in the area to the extreme east of the country, with an increase between 4.7 and 6%, is higher than the surrounding areas.

Notice that figures are quoted only to make a particular point.

Previous knowledge of the geography of France is not necessary.

Use only locations shown on the map. Compass directions should be used to refer to parts of the map.

Most GCSE geography examinations include work on Ordnance Survey maps. This may be an entire question or a piece of stimulus within a question testing a particular part of the syllabus. The scales used are mostly 1:25,000 or 1:50,000. The questions test basic map reading skills, as well as description and interpretation of maps.

The basic map reading skills concern four and six-figure grid references, measurement of distance, compass directions and map symbols. The map usually has a key so there is no need to learn the symbols off by heart.

Questions will often ask you to draw annotated sketch maps or cross-sections. Cross-sections are useful for showing relief or a particular physical feature. Remember that a sketch map is a view from above, whereas a cross-section is a view from the side. Label cross-sections using arrows over the surface: label

Use technical terms such as convex/concave, dip/scarp, etc. when describing slopes. Use the correct technical terms for landforms too, e.g. valley, plateau, steep-sided hill. The closer together the contours the steeper the slope. Try to recognise distinctive landforms by the pattern of their contours. For examples of this, see the reverse side of this card.

Recognising landforms using map contours Remember that you will be asked to describe a landscape. If the question is specific to map reading you will not be asked to explain how the landform came about; unless the map is part of a physical geography question.

It is useful to memorise a series of checklists for answering map reading questions. This will help you to organise your answers and show the examiner that you can answer methodically.

Description of relief

What is the highest point? What is the average height? What kind are slopes are present?

Description of drainage

(This is the pattern of rivers and surface streams.) What are the main rivers? In which direction do they flow? Are there any major watersheds?

Description of coast

In which direction does the coast run? Is it smooth or irregular? Are there signs of erosion or deposition? Are there any beaches or sand dunes? Is there any evidence of coastal management?

Description of settlement

What is the general shape of the built-up area? Have any physical features influenced this shape? Have communications influenced the settlement’s growth? Was the original site a wet-point or a dry-point?

Can you recognise the CBD, the inner city and the suburban areas by the road pattern?

2 It does not face open sea (1) so it may be more sheltered than other parts of the coast. (1) There is a large area of sand at low tide. (1) This question is more difficult because you are asked to interpret the map not just describe it.

3 The area is sparsely settled. (1) Settlement consists of a series of randomly spaced isolated farms and hamlets. (1) Remember, state general terms first, then specific points.

4 There is a source of fresh water from the stream (1) so it is a wet-point settlement. (1) It is at the head of Hayle Bay and therefore well sheltered. (1) The land around the bay is not too steep for building houses. The rest of the coast has steep cliffs.

(1) You need to give a reason for each of the points you make.

5 The oldest part of the settlement appears to be Polzeath (1) which developed where the stream enters Hayle Bay (1). The settlement appears to have grown north (1) to New Polzeath and south (1) to Trebetherick. There has been ribbon development (1) along the roads especially in Trebetherick.

New developments (1) appear to be present west of the road towards The Greenaway. Evidence for this is the more modern, geometric pattern of the roads. Remember to include both description and explanation in your answer. Use technical terms whenever possible.

E X A M I N A T I O N T E C H N I Q U E S ( 1 ) However well you have learnt your work, you must write it down in a suitable way in an examination to gain credit. This means answering each question in the way that the examiner asks. The key to this is understanding the command words, making the right choice of optional questions and appreciating how your answer will be marked.

Make sure that you are fully aware of the parts of the syllabus being tested in each question paper and the form the questions will take.

Some questions may require one word or short paragraph answers, others may be multiple choice. Essays are not very common in GCSE Geography examinations but there will be opportunities to write in continuous prose. These are more common in Higher Tier papers targeted at Grades A*–D(E).

If there is a choice of questions in a paper, make sure that you answer the correct number of questions from the right sections. Do not be unduly influenced by the stimulus material at the start of the question when choosing. Read the whole question. Most marks are allocated to the last part of a question. Decide whether you are happy with this section before choosing.

Read the question very carefully. Underline the key words and phrases. Make sure that you understand how many examples or case studies you need to use. Be wary of scale. If a question asks for a named location, a country or a continent is too large an area.

If you are asked to name a tourist development in a LEDC, Blackpool or Spain is wrong.

Make the most of the sketch maps and diagrams provided. You will drop marks if you do not use maps and diagrams in a question when it specifically asks you to. Many questions, particularly those testing physical geography, can be answered with annotated diagrams. A simple diagram can save writing a long description.

115

P115-124 9/4/01 2:02 pm Page 116

E X A M I N A T I O N T E C H N I Q U E S ( 2 ) Make sure that your examples are filled with facts, statistics and precise locations. When describing climate use appropriate figures.

Do not use vague generalisations. You will not gain credit for using words like ‘wet’, ‘dry’ or ‘fertile’. ‘Deep, well-drained’ or ‘rich in nutrients’ are creditworthy alternatives to ‘fertile’.

Make sure that you understand the meaning of command words: Describe: What does a feature or place look like? You will get no credit for explanation or interpretation.

e.g. A corrie is an armchair shaped circular depression on the side of a mountain. It has steep back walls on three sides with a rock lip at the front.

Explain: Give reasons for the formation or location of geographical features.

e.g. The rotational movement of glacier ice forms a corrie. Overdeepening occurs as a result of plucking and abrasion.

State or List: Make a number of brief points. This is the only occasion where there is no need to write in complete sentences.

Remember that there are 5% extra marks for correct spelling, punctuation and grammar (SPaG) in all geography examinations.

This includes credit for the use of technical terms.

Compare: Point out the similarities and differences.

Contrast: Say what the differences are.

Annotate: Add notes to a diagram. These need to be more than simple labels.

To what extent: You need to come to a conclusion by giving different points of view.

GCSE examinations are always positively marked. Marks are not deducted for giving a wrong answer. Try not to leave gaps. Attempt all the questions except those optional ones you have chosen not to answer. Even if you have to guess an answer you stand a better chance of getting marks. Do not think that by answering all the optional questions you will get a higher mark!

116

P115-124 9/4/01 2:02 pm Page 117

E X A M I N A T I O N T E C H N I Q U E S ( 3 ) Try to complete the full number of questions required. Do not spend too much time on the first question, or those that you know best. If you do not finish the paper you will automatically lose marks. Pace yourself, spending time in proportion to the number of marks available. It is pointless writing a side of text on a question part worth just 2 or 3 marks.

If you do run short of time, answer the last question in coherent note form. The examiner will try to give you credit for any relevant points. If you have written a plan for an answer, do not cross it out until you completed the question. If you run out of time the examiner may be able to award marks for the ideas in your plan.

Write concisely and to the point. Do not waste time writing out the question before starting the answer. The number of marks will give you some indication of how long your answer should be. In many GCSE examinations you write answers on the question paper. The space for each answer is a useful guide too.

Use maps and diagrams effectively as they can save you time. Do not repeat yourself by writing the answer in words and as a diagram. The text will be marked first and if there are still marks available, any additional points in the diagram will be considered.

Remember it is not necessary to write a perfect answer to gain full marks. As soon as you have scored the maximum number of creditworthy points in a question the examiner will stop marking.

The question may indicate how many points you have to make. If you are asked to state two disadvantages of the Green Revolution, you will gain no extra marks for a third.

Never give a series of alternative answers, leaving the examiner to choose the correct one. The first answer is the one that will be marked.

In some questions the examiner will give you a list of answers to choose from. Remember there may be some distractors, or wrong answers among them.

117

P115-124 9/4/01 2:02 pm Page 118

E X A M I N A T I O N T E C H N I Q U E S ( 4 ) GCSE questions are marked in two ways. Sections of questions with 3 or fewer marks are likely to be point marked. There will be one mark for each correct, relevant point. In most cases the wording of a question will indicate whether a question is point marked. If there are three marks for a question asking for three features of an Equatorial ecosystem, the allocation of those marks is obvious.

Level-marked questions will usually have four or more marks allocated to them. On Foundation Tier papers targeted at Grades C–G there are usually two levels. On Higher Tier papers three levels are more common. The question will be marked as a whole, and it is not necessary for your answer to go through all the levels. If the first sentence is of Level 3 standard then the minimum score will be at the bottom of the Level 3 range of marks. A typical mark scheme may be divided as follows: Level 1, 1–3 marks; Level 2, 4–6 marks and Level 3, 7–8 marks. There is a maximum number of marks for statements of a particular standard. For this mark scheme, only three Level 2 statements will be credited. If the whole answer consists of Level 1 statements, then the maximum score will be three. Two Level 3 statements will get full marks.

Aim to answer the question at the highest possible level. Basic statements will not get beyond Level 1. Level 2 answers should contain clear statements with reference perhaps to a named example. Level 3 answers contain even more detailed information, often using case study material.

Now look at the following questions and find out how they would be marked.

Explain why long-term aid is better than short-term aid. (8 marks) A typical mark scheme would look like this: Level 1 Basic (1–2 marks)

Simple statements, e.g. Short-term aid gives food to the starving.

There is no long-term effect.

118

P115-124 9/4/01 2:02 pm Page 119

E X A M I N A T I O N T E C H N I Q U E S ( 5 ) Level 2 Clear (3–5 marks)

Long-term aid helps people to help themselves, so they are better prepared for the next food shortage, e.g. Band Aid.

Level 3 Detailed (6–8 marks)

Details are given of a particular aid scheme referring to the advantages of the long-term increase in food production, e.g. the former USSR

part-funded the Aswan Dam. Previously, food production relied on flood water for irrigation, so farming was possible for only short periods. The dam allowed long-term irrigation and more than one crop of rice could be harvested each year. Farming became a year-round activity increasing financial stability.

Explain why the use of appropriate technology may become very important in reducing starvation in the world. (6 marks) Level 1 Basic (1–2 marks)

Simple statements showing how the food supply will increase without saying how the appropriate technology will make it possible, e.g. The new hoe means that crops can be grown more easily.

Level 2 Clear (3–4 marks)

The detail is accurate and shows understanding, e.g. One person still needs to operate the improved hoe, but the larger blade is more effective. It allows the person to hoe a larger area in a shorter time.

Level 3 Detailed (5–6 marks)

Detailed understanding, possibly supported by case studies or exemplars. For example, wind pumps in Kenya allow a fresh supply of water to be brought to remote areas where it would be too expensive to build a larger system. This could serve up to 400 people a day.

Local people can be trained to make and repair the pumps easily. The constant water supply will allow farming throughout the year and a greater range of crops to be grown.

i Tokyo. (1) The first question is usually very straightforward.

ii Seven. (1) Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Osaka, Paris, Moscow and London.

iii The population of cities in LEDCs has grown. (1) The population of cities in MEDCs has remained much the same. (1) Do not be afraid to state the obvious.

i There will be a concentration of commercial activities such as shops and offices (1). The cost of land will be very expensive.(1) There will be a concentration of multi-storey buildings. (1) People move around mainly on foot.

(1) Four separate points are needed.

ii The expensive, modern high-rise flats are near to the city centre. The people who live in them will work in the CBD.

The poor quality housing with basic amenities may be larger buildings, which are in multi-occupancy, often single males waiting for their families to join them from the countryside. The low cost government housing on the outer edge are former shanty towns which have been improved with the aid of government grants and foreign aid. The shanty towns on the edge of the city are low quality, unplanned houses occupied by recent migrants.

(4) Four separate points needed. You are being asked to interpret the diagram. You may make use of case studies to answer this question.

iii The poorest quality housing will be near the city centre.

There will be a steady improvement in the quality of the housing as you move outwards from the city centre. (2) Two separate points are needed. Other possible answers are: lack of shanty towns and larger areas of suburban housing.

SCORE

3 Level 1 Basic (1–2 marks)

Simple statements such as new water supplies, sewerage systems, better built houses.

Level 2 Clear (3–4 marks)

There will be reference to a case study by name only, but without any detail, e.g. Nairobi. Only one solution may be considered. There will be some development of the points made. For example, improving the job prospects of the people living in shanty towns, so that there will be more money available. The answer will not say how more jobs are made available or what the benefits are of there being more money around.

Level 3 Detailed (5–6 marks)

More than one example used to show the different methods, such as those undertaken by the inhabitants themselves and those used by the government. For example: Site and service schemes (Lusaka, Zambia). Authorities provide basic room and veranda with basic public utilities and infrastructure. Inhabitants are responsible for providing for the rest of their particular family’s needs.

Kampungs (Djakarta, Indonesia).

Government takes over whole districts and improves the environment, i.e. houses, roads, water and sewerage system.

Notice that the question asks for more than one solution.

This is why you need to read questions very carefully.
