INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION TO THE COURSE
This book has been written to help all students taking the Edexcel International GCSE English Language A (4EA1)
(first examination June 2018). It is designed to enable them to achieve their full potential during the course and in
the examination. It is written for both students and teachers. There are two specifications for the International GCSE
examination, English Language A (4EA1) and English Language B (4EB1). Specification A of the International GCSE
has two routes, one assessed entirely through examination and one that includes coursework. This book will prepare
students for all aspects of the course.

STUDENTS

How will this book support you? We hope you will find it:
◼◼ useful in terms of developing your skills and techniques fully for the Edexcel International GCSE in English Language
◼◼ a helpful guide to your study of the selected texts from the Edexcel Anthology for the International GCSE
◼◼ a support in preparing for unseen passages (all specifications).
This book will also assist in writing the coursework and planning revision.

STUDENTS AND TEACHERS

The book goes through the requirements for specification A, with explanations, suggestions and questions. It also
includes a large number of practical activities and examples. These are for practice and will also help you to appreciate
how really good answers are written and structured.
HINT

Remember to plan your work. The sooner you organise yourself and your ideas, the easier you will find your preparation for every section of
the examination! This book aims to give you confidence by improving your skills and techniques. You know you can succeed.

KNOW YOUR TEXTS

It is very important to make sure that you have a really good grasp of the selected fiction and non-fiction passages and
poems from Section A and Section B of the Anthology. Every year, examiners read International GCSE scripts in which
the candidates write in a way that shows that they do not understand, or have not prepared carefully, the texts that are
set. Use the relevant sections from this book to strengthen your knowledge of the texts.

USE YOUR SOURCES

An important part of Paper 1 is the testing of your ability to think on your feet when confronted with unfamiliar (unseen)
prose passages, to show that you have all understood and responded to these and that you can base your own writing
on the ideas you have met. Work through the ‘Types of text’ chapter in order to ensure that you are ready to read and
analyse an unseen passage in Paper 1.

KNOW AND APPLY PROPERLY YOUR TECHNICAL TERMS

Like other subjects, English has a number of technical terms which you may need to use. It is important that you know
how to use the correct term and that you can spell it. Refer to the subject vocabulary within the margins or the Glossary
on pages 192–197 to help you. Even more important is that you know how to explain why a particular device is used,
looking at the writer’s intentions. In the exams, you will always be given credit for explaining the effects of a word or
phrase, whether or not you use the technical terms, and accurate use of the right terms will make your writing more
fluent and concise.
HINT

Make lists of technical terms, write out what you think they mean, then check your definitions against the glossary at the back or the lists of
subject vocabulary in the margins.

INTRODUCTION

EXPLORE HOW TO IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION OF YOUR
ANSWERS

If you look closely at the model answers that are given at various points throughout this book, this will help you to write
detailed, successful responses.

PRESENTING YOUR WORK EFFECTIVELY

How you set out your own writing is important for various reasons. Get into the habit of producing writing that is:
◼◼ neat, regular and clear
◼◼ correctly punctuated
◼◼ spelt accurately
◼◼ set out in clear paragraphs.
Such strengths in your writing will bring many advantages, both in the examination and afterwards.
◼◼ Examiners will form a positive impression of your work.
◼◼ They will be able to read your answer easily; they will not be able to do so if your handwriting is poor or if it is not
written in proper sentences.
◼◼ How you write, as well as what you write, will be considered when your work is marked.
◼◼ Good writing is useful for applications for jobs or college courses.
◼◼ Many jobs need people who can write clearly, accurately and precisely.

KNOWING YOUR OWN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

It is an excellent idea to keep a checklist of your most common errors in spelling, punctuation and grammar, since these
are assessed in all specifications. When you receive a piece of work back from your teacher, read it through and make
sure you understand any comments or corrections.
◼◼ Keep a sheet of file paper at the front or back of your work file and write the correct spelling of words you have
misspelt on it.
◼◼ Refer to this before handing in your work, to make sure you have not made the same mistakes.
◼◼ Take some time to learn the spellings and other points on your list.

▼ REMEMBER!

Make the best use of lesson time.
Make sure you know what you have to do in class.
Be sure you understand what the homework is.

◼◼ Add points missed onto the end of your homework or
practice questions when they are returned to you.

Hand work in on time.
Keep files or exercise books up to date.
Make sure you do not get behind with your homework.
Do not leave work unfinished. It is always difficult to remember
what has been missed unless you amend it at the time.
◼◼ Check off completed work in your records

◼◼ Write down key points from: teachers; books you read;

▼ SEEK HELP!

◼◼ Ask teachers to explain if you are unsure.
◼◼ Discuss with friends.
◼◼ Look things up using dictionaries, encyclopaedias and the
Internet.

TEXT ANALYSIS SKIMMING FOR THE MAIN IDEA OR THEME

LESSON OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to
◼ understand the main ideas
that a writer is communicating
◼ summarise the key points of a
text quickly
◼ build confidence in
independent reading

TEXT ANALYSIS SKIMMING FOR THE MAIN IDEA OR THEME

SKIMMING AND SCANNING

TEST YOURSELF!

It can be difficult to know where to start when approaching a text
for the first time. To be confident in handling new texts, you need
a methodical approach that allows you to understand the main
ideas that are being communicated.
Skimming and scanning are two important reading techniques.
They are often confused with one another but they are very
different skills, though both help you to achieve the same aim: to
read more quickly and effectively.

KEY POINTS

What you read is more important than
what you leave out.

▶

SKIMMING

SKIMMING AND SKIPPING

This is useful when you want to get a general idea of what a text is about in
a short space of time. It means looking through material quickly for a sense
of the topic and the ideas and information being conveyed. When you skim,
you read through an article three to four times faster than when you read
each word.

WHEN SHOULD I SKIM?
◼
◼
◼
◼
◼
◼

When reading non-fiction texts
When you have a lot to read in a short space of time
When revising topics to identify key information
To locate and identify reliable information when researching a topic
To identify what information is not relevant when researching a topic
When you already have some background information about a
particular topic and want to find out something new

SKIMMING OR SCANNING?
Read the following examples and identify which describes the process of
skimming, and which describes scanning.
1 You flick through a financial report to find a particular set of data.
2 You quickly go through a twenty-page report in a few minutes, and
determine the overall subject, tone, and a few key points.
3 You pick up a newspaper at a coffee shop, look over the first few pages,
and gather some general information about the events happening in
the world.
4 You open a local newspaper, find the section advertising rooms for rent,
and then mark a few advertisements in your desired location within your
price range.

SKIMMING OR SCANNING?
To skim effectively, you don’t read everything – you must skip, too. So what
material should you read and what should you leave out? These reading
strategies for active reading should help you:
1 Highlight key points.
2 Consider each paragraph by rephrasing the first point of each in your
own words.
3 Underline any unfamiliar words. Can you use the context of the sentence to
help you establish their meaning? If not, use a dictionary to help you.

STRATEGIES FOR SKIMMING
Read the first sentences of each paragraph (this is called the topic
sentence) – this will give you a good sense of the ideas and structure of
the text.

SCANNING

Read the first and last paragraphs.

Scanning refers to reading through material to find specific information.
When you scan, you run your eyes over information to pull out specific
words, phrases, or information. You may not be aware of it but you scan
many types of material in your daily life, from the television guide to the
football results in the newspaper.

Some pieces of writing have headings and subheadings. These are a
useful guide to the information being communicated.

WHEN SHOULD I SCAN?
◼ When looking for specific pieces of information quickly
◼ To locate a relevant quotation or section in a literature text

Otatet fuga. Cate voloratio molorem cum, qui
voluptam fuga. Ximolut
aturio. Itat voluptae dolupit quatur alitionsedit

3

STRATEGIES FOR SCANNING
For scanning to be successful, you need to be sure of your purpose, ie
what information you are looking for, before you begin.
You should consider the structure of the text. Is it arranged alphabetically,
by category, chronologically (in time order) or in another way?
You can use your index finger to help you to identify key information, for
example, a train or bus time. Move it down the text with your eyes to
maintain focus.

this course. They can be taught as blocks at the start of the course or integrated into relevant sections of the texts being
studied.
The Paper 1 and Paper 2 chapters cover all of the content required by the course, mirroring the two exam papers for
those taking this route. The information in the Paper 2 chapter will also work for anybody taking the coursework route.
This is then supplemented by the Paper 3 chapter, which gives advice on this paper for those taking this route.
For each section or Anthology text, information is interspersed with activities in order to put learning into practice and
exam-style questions to help you prepare and practise for the exam. Other features help to expand your knowledge and
reinforce your learning. All Anthology texts are reproduced in full, with detailed analysis and questions for each text.

You can learn a great deal about the different characters by studying a
particular scene in detail. A good example is the central scene (Act 3,
Scene 1) in which Romeo kills Tybalt.
Working with a partner, in a group or by yourself, think about and make
notes on the following points.

◼ Whether the fighting and killing are presented as inevitable.
◼ Links with the fight at the start of the play.
◼ How the audience feels about Romeo at the end of the scene.

be called infatuation; he is immediately shown as completely love-struck,
but the superficiality of his feelings is underlined by the speed with which he
abandons them at the sight of Juliet.
The play gives several examples of close friendship as a form of love,
particularly the protective love shown by the Nurse to Juliet and the Friar to
Romeo; as well as the ‘laddish’ friendships of the young men, which are still
instantly recognisable in any street in Italy today, and marked by what the
Italians themselves call braggadocio (a kind of boastful swagger). However,
such friendship can generate fierce loyalty, to the point of being willing to die
for one’s friend, as happens with Mercutio.

MARRIAGE
There is also the view in 17th–century society that marriage is above all a
business contract, in which love is not a very important consideration: Paris
wishes to marry Juliet, but admits that he has ‘little talked of love’, and even
Juliet, when asked how she feels about the idea of marriage to Paris, only says
‘I’ll look to like’, showing that she has little emotional investment in the idea,
but will simply try the idea.
SUBJECT VOCABULARY

witticism a clever amusing remark
GENERAL VOCABULARY

jesting saying things that you do not really
mean in order to amuse people

SEX AND SEXUAL REFERENCES
Part of the overall treatment of love is that of sexual love. Although, clearly, the
marriage of Romeo and Juliet is happily consummated, many of the references
to sex are not directly linked to their love. Instead they are there to provide
an endless source of complicated puns and witticisms, particularly for the
young men and in some instances for the Nurse. Such jesting treats love in an
altogether more basic way than the idealism of the central relationship.

READING SKILLS

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand the main ideas
that a writer is communicating
◼◼ summarise the key points of a
text quickly
◼◼ build confidence in
independent reading.

TEXT ANALYSIS

SKIMMING AND SCANNING
It can be difficult to know where to start when approaching a text
for the first time. You need a methodical approach that allows you
to understand the main ideas that are being communicated.
Skimming and scanning are two important reading techniques.
They are often confused with one another, but they are very
different skills. However, both help you to achieve the same aim:
to read more quickly and effectively.
SKIMMING

KEY POINT

Skimming and scanning are important
reading techniques. Skimming is
reading quickly to get a general sense
of a text. Scanning involves looking
through a text for specific information.

Skimming is useful when you want to quickly get a general idea of what a
text is about. When you skim, you read through the text three to four times
faster than when you read each word in order to get a sense of the topic,
ideas and information being conveyed.

WHEN SHOULD I SKIM?
◼◼
◼◼
◼◼
◼◼

When you have a lot to read in a short space of time.
When revising topics to identify key information.
When locating a passage in a text.
To find relevant material when planning an essay.

SCANNING
Scanning refers to reading through material to find specific information.
When you scan, you run your eyes over the information in a text and pull
out specific words, phrases or pieces of information. You may not realise,
but you scan through different texts every day, from television guides to
football results.

WHEN SHOULD I SCAN?
◼◼ When looking for specific pieces of information quickly.
◼◼ To locate a relevant quotation or section in a literature text.

ACTIVITY 1
HINT

To skim effectively, you don’t read
everything. What you read is more
important than what you skip. Try to:
◼◼ highlight key points
◼◼ rephrase the main point of each
paragraph in your own words
◼◼ underline any unfamiliar words.

▼ SKIMMING OR SCANNING?
Read the following examples and identify which describes the process
of skimming and which describes scanning.
1 You flick through a financial report to find a particular set of data.
2 You quickly go through a twenty-page report in a few minutes to
determine the overall subject, tone and a few key points.
3 You pick up a newspaper at a coffee shop, look over the first few
pages and gather some general information about the events
happening in the world.

◼◼ Read the topic sentence. This will give you a good sense of the ideas and
structure of the whole text.
◼◼ Read the first and last paragraphs.
◼◼ Use chapter names, headings and subheadings as a guide.

STRATEGIES FOR SCANNING
◼◼ For scanning to be successful, be sure of your purpose. Think about what
information you are looking for before you begin to scan the text.
◼◼ Consider how the text is structured. Is it arranged alphabetically, by
category, chronologically or does it use other devices such as flashback?
◼◼ Use your index finger to help you, such as when scanning a timetable for a
train time. Move your finger down the text at the same time as your eyes to
help you to maintain focus.

READING SKILLS

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ interpret the information and
ideas in a text
◼◼ read between the lines to work
out what the text implies.

TEXT ANALYSIS

EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT MEANING
To be a good reader, you need to understand both what a text tells
you directly, or explicitly, and to infer based on what you think
the writer indirectly, or implicitly, suggests in their text. This may
be about the writer’s views, character or theme.

▶

SUBJECT VOCABULARY

infer read between the lines
KEY POINT

Explicit meaning is where the writer
explains their ideas.
Implicit meaning is where the writer
implies their ideas; you have to infer
and imagine based on what you know.

▲ A couple on their wedding day.

EXPLICIT MEANING

The picture shows a woman in a dress holding flowers and standing close
to a man in a suit.

IMPLICIT MEANING

We may be able to infer that this is a wedding photograph because we
have experience of seeing this type of image being related to weddings.

▼ AN EXTRACT FROM A WALK IN THE WOODS
BY BILL BRYSON
We hiked till five and camped beside a tranquil spring in a small, grassy
clearing in the trees just off the trail. Because it was our first day back on the
trail, we were flush for food, including perishables like cheese and bread that
had to be eaten before they went off or were shaken to bits in our
packs, so we rather gorged ourselves, then sat around smoking and chatting
idly until persistent and numerous midgelike creatures (no-see-ums, as they
are universally known along the trail) drove us into our tents. It was perfect
sleeping weather, cool enough to need a bag but warm enough that you could
sleep in your underwear, and I was looking forward to a long night’s snooze
– indeed was enjoying a long night’s snooze – when, at some indeterminate
dark hour, there was a sound nearby that made my eyes fly open. Normally,
I slept through everything – through thunderstorms, through Katz’s snoring
and noisy midnight pees – so something big enough or distinctive enough to
wake me was unusual. There was a sound of undergrowth being disturbed
– a click of breaking branches, a weighty pushing through low foliage – and
then a kind of large, vaguely irritable snuffling noise.

Bear!
I sat bolt upright. Instantly every neuron in my brain was awake and
dashing around frantically, like ants when you disturb their nest. I reached
instinctively for my knife, then realized I had left it in my pack, just outside
the tent. Nocturnal defense had ceased to be a concern after many successive
nights of tranquil woodland repose. There was another noise, quite near.
“Stephen, you awake?” I whispered.
“Yup,” he replied in a weary but normal voice.
“What was that?”
“How the hell should I know?”
“It sounded big.”
“Everything sounds big in the woods.”
This was true. Once a skunk had come plodding through our camp and it
had sounded like a stegosaurus.

▶▶ Which words and phrases allow us to infer his thoughts and feelings?
Draw a table with two columns, one for each question, and pick out the
key words and phrases which convey explicit and implicit meaning.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ organise your ideas and
structure your writing clearly
and with direction.

MAKING THE PERFECT POINT
HINT

A quotation does not have to be direct
speech: you can quote evidence from a
science journal or a famous play in the
same way.

SUBJECT VOCABULARY

quotations words quoted from a text
quotation marks punctuation marks used
to indicate where you have quoted, ‘like
this’
direct speech words spoken by a
character in a novel, play or poem
diction the writer’s choice of words

TEXT ANALYSIS

POINT EVIDENCE EXPLAIN
When writing, it is important to express points in a clear and
structured way. We organise writing into paragraphs. Each
paragraph should be self-contained and make sense on its own.
It should be constructed of a group of sentences which all link to
the same idea, theme or topic.

▶

The P-E-E chain stands for Point-Evidence-Explain. This is the order in which
you should organise the information in each paragraph that you write.
1 State your basic point clearly and concisely. Your point should be relevant
to the task or question that you have been set.
2 Demonstrate how you can support your opening statement with reference
to a specific part of the text that you are writing about. Quotations can
be used as evidence to support what you are saying and to help you to
make your point. Try to select words or phrases from the text that precisely
support your point and keep them as brief as possible. Use inverted
commas, also known as quotation marks, to indicate where you have used
words directly from another text.
3 Add an explanation. The first step is to explain how your quotation supports
the point that you have made so that your reader knows why you have
included it. In English Language, it is often useful to consider the use of
language, going into some detail about the writer’s choice of words (this is
also known as diction) and considering any linguistic devices or techniques
which have been used.

PERFECT PUNCTUATION

Short quotations of a single line or part of a line should be incorporated within
quotation marks as part of the running text of your essay, ‘just like this’.
Quotations of two or more full lines should be indented from the main body of
the text and introduced by a colon, like this:
‘this is how you would quote a longer piece of text, but make sure that it
is all relevant.’

PARAGRAPH SANDWICHES

You can think of your paragraph like a sandwich or burger, with three separate
parts.
Top bun: opening topic sentence
Introduces the paragraph and your
main idea.
Fillings: supporting sentences
This is the main part. Describe
and explain your main point
using quotes and evidence to
complement and support it.
Bottom bun: closing sentence
A concluding sentence to bring
everything together

▼ SUMMARISING WITH P-E-E
KEY POINT

Follow these four rules for excellent
writing:
1 Structure: Ideas must be clearly
expressed and logically sequenced.
2 Paragraphs: Paragraphs should be
well constructed and follow on from
one another. Quotations should be
correctly presented.
3 Vocabulary: Use a wide range of key
vocabulary with precision.
4 Spelling, punctuation and grammar:
Maintain accuracy throughout.

Read this chain paragraph, summarising the novel Of Mice and Men
by John Steinbeck. Copy the paragraph and colour code or label each
part of the P-E-E chain. Each part of the chain may be more than one
sentence.
Set in the Great Depression of the 1930s, the novel tells of the close
friendship between two farm workers, George and Lennie: ‘I got you
to look after me, and you got me to look after you.’ The other men
on the ranch are described as ‘the loneliest guys in the world’ and
George and Lennie are proud of the fact that they have each other.
The repetition of the second person pronoun ‘you’ here emphasises
the close and reciprocal bond between the men. George and Lennie
often repeat this line to one another when they are talking about
their dreams for the future and Lennie is always excited when George
reaffirms their friendship in this way. Their friendship gives them hope
and joy in a desolate world.

Using a set text from your English studies, write your own question
and P-E-E chain paragraph about a character or theme. The following
questions are examples to help you to construct a question based on
your own reading.

▶▶ How is the protagonist portrayed in the novel?
SUBJECT VOCABULARY

▶▶ What is the main theme of the novel?

protagonist the main character

▶▶ What is the author trying to convey through the novel?
▶▶ How does the opening set the scene for the novel?
Give your question and paragraph to a partner and check one another’s
work. Consider the following questions and clearly label examples of
each within the paragraph.
Does the paragraph include:
◼◼ a Point?
◼◼ some Evidence: a quotation or example?
◼◼ an Explanation: an exploration of the quotation and what it shows?
This may include:
>> some comment on the language or literary devices used
>> some understanding of the writer’s attitude
>> a personal response to the characters or themes of a text.

EVALUATING A TEXT

This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ approach a non-fiction text
critically
◼◼ recognise fact and opinion and
follow an argument
◼◼ build confidence in responding
to a text
◼◼ understand how writers use
language to influence their
readers.

This section will help you to prepare for Paper 1 Section A, which
will test your reading and critical skills. There will be questions on
both a prepared and an unprepared non-fiction reading passage.
This will be drawn from a range of contemporary non-fiction,
including autobiography, travel writing, reportage, media articles,
letters, diary entries and opinion pieces. You will find additional
information on this section of the examination on pages xx-xx.

EVALUATING A TEXT: A GUIDE
SUBJECT VOCABULARY

rhetorical device - using language in a
certain way to achieve an effect

▶

When you read a text, you form an opinion. Understanding how writers present
ideas is key to understanding how texts work. You need to be aware of a
variety of ways in which writers use language to influence their readers. The
devices used tend to be linked to the purpose of the text. So a text which
tries to persuade a reader of a particular opinion will use rhetorical devices,
while a text which describes another country is likely to use a wide range of
descriptive and figurative devices to establish a vivid sense of place.
When you read a new piece of non-fiction, you should first try to understand
what points are being made.

▼ ‘IT’S SO OVER: COOL CYBERKIDS ABANDON SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES’ FROM THE
GUARDIAN
From uncles wearing skinny jeans to mothers investing in ra-ra skirts and fathers nodding awkwardly along to the
latest grime record, the older generation has long known that the surest way to kill a youth trend is to adopt it as its
own. The cyberworld, it seems, is no exception.
The proliferation of parents and teachers trawling the pages of Facebook trying to poke old schoolfriends and
lovers, and traversing the outer reaches of MySpace is causing an adolescent exodus from the social networking
sites, according to research from the media regulator Ofcom.
The sites, once the virtual streetcorners, pubs and clubs for millions of 15- to 24-year-olds, have now been over-run
by 25- to 34-year-olds whose presence is driving their younger peers away.
Although their love of being online shows no sign of abating, the percentage of 15- to 24-year-olds who have a
profile on a social networking site has dropped for the first time – from 55% at the start of last year to 50% this
year. In contrast, 46% of 25- to 34-year-olds are now regularly checking up on sites such as Facebook compared
with 40% last year.
Overall, 30% of British adults have a social networking profile, against 21% in 2007 when Ofcom first did the
research. Half the UK's online population have a Facebook profile and spend an average of nearly six hours a
month on the site compared with four hours in May 2008.
“There is nothing to suggest overall usage of the internet among 15-to 24-year-olds is going down,” said Peter
Phillips, the regulator’s head of strategy. “Data suggests they are spending less time on social networking sites.”
James Thickett, director of market research at Ofcom, said that while older people seemed to be embracing social
networking sites, Facebook and MySpace remained immensely popular with children under 16.

“Clearly take-up among under 16-year-olds is very high … so we cannot say for certain whether this is people
in a certain age group who are not setting up social networking profiles or whether it’s a population shift which
is reflecting people getting older and having a social networking profile that they set up two years ago,” he said.
“The main point is the profile of social networking users is getting older.”
The arrival of the 25- to 34-year-old age group, meanwhile, also appears to be behind the explosion in usage of
Twitter.

▼ ‘SOCIAL WEBSITES HARM CHILDREN’S BRAIN’ FROM MAIL ONLINE
Social networking websites are causing alarming changes in the brains of young users, an eminent scientist has warned.
Sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Bebo are said to shorten attention spans, encourage instant gratification and make
young people more self-centred.
The claims from neuroscientist Susan Greenfield will make disturbing reading for the millions whose social lives depend
on logging on to their favourite websites each day.
But they will strike a chord with parents and teachers who complain that many youngsters lack the ability to
communicate or concentrate away from their screens.
More than 150 million use Facebook to keep in touch with friends, share photographs and videos and post regular
updates of their movements and thoughts.
A further six million have signed up to Twitter, the ‘micro-blogging’ service that lets users circulate text messages about
themselves.
But while the sites are popular – and extremely profitable – a growing number of psychologists and neuroscientists
believe they may be doing more harm than good.
Baroness Greenfield, an Oxford University neuroscientist and director of the Royal Institution, believes repeated
exposure could effectively ‘rewire’ the brain.
Computer games and fast-paced TV shows were also a factor, she said.
‘We know how small babies need constant reassurance that they exist,’ she told the Mail yesterday.
‘My fear is that these technologies are infantilising the brain into the state of small children who are attracted by
buzzing noises and bright lights, who have a small attention span and who live for the moment.’
Her comments echoed those she made during a House of Lords debate earlier this month. Then she argued that
exposure to computer games, instant messaging, chat rooms and social networking sites could leave a generation with
poor attention spans.
‘I often wonder whether real conversation in real time may eventually give way to these sanitised and easier screen
dialogues, in much the same way as killing, skinning and butchering an animal to eat has been replaced by the
convenience of packages of meat on the supermarket shelf,’ she said.

TEXT ANALYSIS

Lady Greenfield told the Lords a teacher of 30 years had told her she had noticed a sharp decline in the ability of her
pupils to understand others.
‘It is hard to see how living this way on a daily basis will not result in brains, or rather minds, different from those of
previous generations,’ she said.
She pointed out that autistic people, who usually find it hard to communicate, were particularly comfortable using
computers.
‘Of course, we do not know whether the current increase in autism is due more to increased awareness and diagnosis of
autism, or whether it can – if there is a true increase – be in any way linked to an increased prevalence among people of
spending time in screen relationships. Surely it is a point worth considering,’ she added.
Psychologists have also argued that digital technology is changing the way we think. They point out that students no
longer need to plan essays before starting to write – thanks to word processors they can edit as they go along. Satellite
navigation systems have negated the need to decipher maps.
A study by the Broadcaster Audience Research Board found teenagers now spend seven-and-a-half hours a day in front
of a screen.
Educational psychologist Jane Healy believes children should be kept away from computer games until they are seven.
Most games only trigger the ‘flight or fight’ region of the brain, rather than the vital areas responsible for reasoning.
Sue Palmer, author of Toxic Childhood, said: ‘We are seeing children’s brain development damaged because they don’t
engage in the activity they have engaged in for millennia.
‘I’m not against technology and computers. But before they start social networking, they need to learn to make real
relationships with people.’

‘MYTH OF THE TEENAGER’, BY LUCY MADDOX
Teenagers often get a bad press. There are easy stories to be mined here:
ASBOs, underage drinking, “hug a hoodie,” drug use–even, recently, the
teenager who drugged her parents to access the internet.
These are not new stereotypes. As a shepherd in Shakespeare’s A Winter’s
Tale puts it, “I would there were no age between 10 and three-and-20, or that
youth would sleep out the rest; for there is nothing in the between but getting
wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting.” Change the
syntax, and this description could easily fit in many newspapers today.
Are the stereotypes fair? Is the idea of wild adolescence rooted in evidence?
There are two sorts of arguments. On the one hand, neuroscientific evidence
seems increasingly to suggest that this is a true developmental phase of its
own—teenagers behave differently because their brains are different. On the
other, some argue that teenagers behave differently because they are learning
to handle so many new situations, and if we hold stereotypical ideas about
their behaviour, we risk underestimating them.
Take the latter argument first. Philip Graham, a professor of psychiatry who
has written extensively on what he perceives to be a misconception, believes
that although hormonal and physical changes are occurring, most teenagers
are not risky or moody. Graham sees teenagers as a stigmatised group, often
highly competent yet treated as if they were not. He argues that teenagers
need to be acknowledged as potentially productive members of society and
that the more independence and respect they are given, the more they will
rise to the challenge.
“Once young people reach the age of 14, their competence in cognitive
tasks and their sexual maturity make it more helpful to think of them as
young adults,” says Graham. “Media coverage is almost uniformly negative.
Adolescence is a word used to describe undesirable behaviour in older adults.
Young people of 14, 15 or 16 are thought to be risk-takers… they are people
who are experimenting. They are doing things for the first time and they make
mistakes. Would you call a toddler who is learning to walk and who falls over
all the time a risk-taker? These people are just beginning something.”
Graham places less importance on the conclusions of research into risktaking and on adolescent brain changes – “Not to say there are not a small
minority who do take dangerous risks but I think the results have been overgeneralised to justify the stereotype.”
Instead, Graham argues that the way teenagers make decisions is related to
encountering situations they haven’t dealt with before. “If they are moving
into new types of social situation they do need more help with that.” He
likens it to learning to drive, something you need expert help with at any age.
However, neuroscientific evidence suggests a basis for the teenage stereotype.
Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a professor at University College London, has
specialised in researching the adolescent brain using a variety of techniques,
including functional brain scanning. Although also concerned that teenagers
can be vilified in the media, Blakemore rejects the idea that adolescence is
entirely a social construct: “If you look throughout history at the descriptions
of adolescence they are similar, and also in different cultures. Of course this is
not to say that all adolescents are the same, but there is quite a lot of evidence
that during this period of life there’s an increase in risk-taking, peer influence

TEXT ANALYSIS

and self-consciousness.” Blakemore’s research suggests that during the teenage
years the brain is still developing the capacity for certain sophisticated skills,
including problem-solving, social skills and impulse control.
Blakemore and other researchers describe a gradual development of
brain areas related to planning, inhibiting inappropriate behaviour
and understanding other points of view. They also suggest a less linear
development of the system in the brain that recognises and responds to
rewards. “Teenagers tend to be more self-conscious,” said Blakemore. “They
show more risk-taking when their peers are present.” Their social brain is
changing and so is their ability to plan, inhibit impulses and make decisions.
“Research by Laurence Steinberg at Temple University in the US has shown
that adolescents tend not to take into account future consequences of actions.
For example, if you offer them a choice between having £10 now and
£100 in six months, whilst adults tend to wait for the larger amount, most
adolescents are more likely to go for the lower value now. Life in the future
doesn’t hold so much importance.”
It might make sense, then, that a teenager trying to decide whether to tell a
lie in order to go out, or to try an illegal drug, might be influenced more by
the reward of the night out or the novel experience, or peer congratulation,
than by longer-term negative consequences. “It’s not that teenagers don’t
understand the risks,” says Blakemore. “It’s just that for some teenagers, in
the moment, this understanding goes out of the window.”
Despite their different views, both academics conclude that teenagers
could benefit from being treated according to their development. Graham
suggests friendly advice-giving. It is important to “recognise their desire for
autonomy,” he says. “They want to do more than they can. We should treat
them differently because they are inexperienced… and first experiences are
important. A bad experience can put you off something for a long time.”
He does not advocate tolerating too much difficult behaviour, though:
“Adolescents are influenced by the stereotype as well. If they expect to
get away with being ‘bolshy’ for example… I don’t think we should be
particularly tolerant of bad behaviour in adolescence.”
Blakemore thinks that we should adjust the way we try to motivate
teenagers: “Anti-smoking campaigns, for example, might be more effective
if they used short-term social negatives like bad breath as a disincentive,
rather than longer-term health consequences. And we perhaps expect
too much. “We expect them to act like adults but their brains aren’t yet
completely like an adult brain. Maybe we should be more understanding.
Teaching adolescents about how their brains develop might be helpful.”

▲ Adolescents often struggle to find their own
identity

Whether you attribute adolescent differences in decision-making to brain
development or lack of experience, educational aims could include the
handling of social dilemmas. Parents might be able to help by being explicit
about the pros and cons of a situation, considering other people’s views or
negotiating in a transparent way. We should also bear in mind that teenagers
are often uniquely affected by economic and political challenges such as high
unemployment levels.
In my view, adolescence is a tricky time, where individuals often struggle to
find their own identity in the face of a sometimes hostile outside world, whilst
needing peer support. Both Blakemore and Graham are more phlegmatic.
“Every time’s a tricky time,” says Graham. “You try being my age.”

◼◼ conjunction
◼◼ pronoun
◼◼ interjection
◼◼ adjective
◼◼ determiners.
◼◼ adverb

▶

Each part of speech signifies how the word is used, not what a word is. This
means that the same word can be a noun in one sentence and a verb or
adjective in the next. For example, the word ‘book’ in the following sentences.
◼◼ Books are made of ink, paper and glue.
(In this case, ‘books’ is a noun and is the subject of the sentence.)
◼◼ Deborah waits patiently while Bridget books the tickets.
(In this case, ‘books’ is a verb and the subject of the sentence is Bridget.)
If you were asked to describe the following photograph, you might say, ‘The
happy lady was laughing’.

Your local newspaper runs a weekly column called ‘Why I love…’, in
which a guest writer is asked to write a short article to inform readers of
a personal interest. Read the following extract, from a piece called ‘Why
I love reading’, and consider the connotations of the highlighted words,
and then answer the question.

KEY POINT

Connotations are how writers are
able to convey their ideas to readers/
inferring information from a text is a
critical skill in understanding what
message and ideas the author wants to
convey to readers.

I love reading because I love getting to know new characters. They
become friends: I inhabit their lives while I read and when I finish
that book, I take a part of them with me. Reading gives me an escape
from reality: it’s my magic carpet that I can fly on whenever I choose,
soaring off on adventures all over the world, from past to present,
over the vast terrains of human history. I can see all of the colours
of life as I go. They say you never read the same book twice: reading
a new book makes me feel slightly new myself because I know
something different; I’ve experienced something more. Reading makes
me a bigger, better, smarter version of myself.

▶ What ideas and attitudes to reading are suggested in the extract?
Copy and complete the following table, considering the connotations
of the highlighted words and phrases used in the extract. Then choose
another quotation from the extract and consider its connotation.

▼ PHRASE

▼ CONNOTATION

‘new characters…
become friends’

By describing characters as ‘friends’, the writer
demonstrates the emotional connection they feel with
books and the companionship they get from reading.

‘it’s my magic carpet'

The metaphor describes reading as a ‘magic carpet’.
This has connotations of adventure and implies the
fantastic experiences that the writer enjoys in reading
books. The ‘magic carpet’ also has connotations of
freedom and flight: books give this reader the wings to
explore worlds which might otherwise be inaccessible
to them.

A sentence is a group of words that make sense on their own.
It is a basic component of communication. Clumsy sentence
structure leads to writing that is grammatically incorrect. Poor
sentence structure will also prevent your ideas flowing in a
coherent and logical way and make it much more difficult for the
reader to understand what you are trying to convey. A writer’s
use of sentence structure often helps to convey meaning in a text.
It is important to be able to identify and comment on this in the

USE OF LANGUAGE

21

A sentence must contain the following parts.
◼◼ The subject identifies the topic of a clause or, in other words, what it
is about. Every complete sentence contains two parts: a subject and a
predicate. The subject is what or whom the sentence is about, and the
predicate tells us something about the subject. In the following sentence,
the predicate is enclosed in brackets ( ), while the subject is highlighted.
My hockey teacher and his dog (go running every morning).
◼◼ The verb identifies the action of a clause or, in other words, what happens.
Her boyfriend gave her a bunch of flowers.
◼◼ The object identifies who or what is directly affected by the action of the
verb. This is always a noun or pronoun. Two kinds of objects follow verbs:
direct and indirect objects.
The example, ‘Her boyfriend gave her a bunch of flowers’, contains a direct
object (‘Her boyfriend’) and an indirect object: in this case the recipient of
the direct object (‘her’).
Not all verbs are followed by objects:
   After work, David usually walks home.
Verbs that take objects are known as transitive verbs. Verbs not followed
by objects are called intransitive verbs. Some verbs can be both.
A sentence may also contain the following:
◼◼ The complement gives extra information about the subject or object.
◼◼ The adverbial gives additional information about a situation: when, where
and how it happened.

COMPOUND SENTENCES

A compound sentence consists of two simple sentences (clauses) joined by
a conjunction. A conjunction is a joining word. It may be used to join two
sentences together.
It was raining. I put up my umbrella. (two sentences)
It was raining so I put up my umbrella. (one sentence with a conjunction)

SUBORDINATE CLAUSES

Subordinate clauses are often present in a sentence. They are called
subordinate as they are second to the main action in the sentence; they are
additional information that the sentence doesn’t need to function.
After his Dad gave him some pocket money, Andrew went to the cinema.
‘After his Dad gave him some pocket money’ is a subordinate clause. Anything
between commas, dashes or brackets would be subordinate clauses too.

COMPLEX SENTENCES

A complex sentence contains a main sentence and one or more subordinate
clauses that contribute to the meaning of the statement.

The window shattered, sending glass cascading in all directions.
Flames exploded into the room. I ducked, keeping my body as low
as I could, desperately trying to avoid the smoke that was rapidly
streaming across the ceiling. I scanned the room for other exits and
was glad to see a small window on the far wall. The smoke was
getting denser and started to expand, the cloud reaching down from
the ceiling to the floor. My brain shouted, ‘Move!’ Frozen. Taking a
deep breath of clean air, possibly my last, I pushed away from the wall
to safety. As I struggled to open the window, I felt my heart pounding.
My lungs screamed for air. The smoke descended and I worked blind,
my eyes stinging. I pulled frantically at the catches, felt them give and
tumbled out onto the ground below. I felt the heat escaping from the
open window above and started to crawl slowly away.

▼ CREATING SUSPENSE
Compare the two extracts below and consider how effectively each has
created a feeling of suspense. The first is written using short simple
sentences and the second uses long complex sentences. Compare
the two passages and then copy out and add to the table that follows,
writing down the effects of using each type of sentence.

EXTRACT 1
▲ “Grasping the handle, she turned it slowly”

KEY POINT

Sentence structure can be used for
particular effect. For example, short,
simple sentences can be used to build
suspense or a sense of actions, whilst
longer, complex sentences may be
helpful in creating a layered character
description.

Running. Faster. Faster. She grabbed the handle and turned it. Pushing
the door open, she moved inside. No one was there. She turned and
fled in the opposite direction.

EXTRACT 2

Jane stood in the doorway collecting her thoughts, delaying her
decision until the last possible moment. As she plucked up her
courage, she studied the door in front of her. It was crafted from an
ancient-looking wood, the handle a simple metal ring. Jane glanced
down at her shaking hand as she stretched out to turn the handle. She
took two deep breaths, brushing her fringe from her pale face with
nervous fingers. She stood a while, thoughts racing through her mind.
Then, at last, she was ready. Grasping the handle, she turned it slowly;
pushing the heavy door in front of her, she stepped into the hallway.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ appreciate a writer’s choice of
words
◼◼ develop your own choice of

VOCABULARY

CHOOSING THE RIGHT VOCABULARY
Your words need to attract the attention of a reader and keep
them engaged so that they will continue to read what we have
written. Choosing the correct vocabulary is central to achieving
this.

▶

Words that engage our senses are particularly effective for this purpose. Look
at these opening sentences:
◼◼ It exploded in her face. (sight)
◼◼ Something was scratching under the door. (sound)
◼◼ From the kitchen came a reminder of the garlic that she loved. (smell)
◼◼ He pulled a face as if he had swallowed sour milk. (taste)
◼◼ The wind brushed his skin. (touch)

▼ ENGAGING THE SENSES

senses: sight, sound, smell, taste and touch.

PRECISION

▶

When you write or speak, your choice of words can be very important,
especially when you write. When you speak, the person who is listening can
ask you to explain yourself if anything you say is not clear. However, when you
write, your reader will probably not be able to ask for an explanation so you
have to get things right first time.
There are times when you need to be precise in your choice of words.
Compare these two sentences:
Some sort of animal could be seen approaching along the side of the road.
A cat could be seen walking cautiously along the gutter.

▶▶ Which of these two sentences is clearer and more precise? Which words and
phrases bring about this effect?
Next, compare these two sentences:

camp and they would make sense. However, one immediately informs you
of the medical precautions that have been taken and this suggests that

there might be a need for medical supervision. The second sentence simply
provides a more appropriate, warmer welcome that expresses a hope that
things go well.
Finally, compare these two sentences:
Put dirty cutlery into the basket on the left and leave dirty crockery next to
the sink on the right, taking care that no uneaten food is dropped carelessly
onto the floor.
Please leave your dirty cutlery and crockery in the places indicated; your
keeping this area clean and tidy will help our staff who will appreciate your
cooperation. Thank you.
The first sentence simply instructs you what to do and anticipates that you
will be careless. The second example contains three very important words,
‘please’ and ‘thank you’. This shows the writer addressing the reader with
respect and consideration by showing why the reader’s taking care will be
appreciated by other people.

These examples show the impact that individual words can have and their
significance in how a sentence is read.

KEY POINT

The bigger your vocabulary, the more
words you have to choose from and
the easier it is to express yourself
clearly. The best way to improve your
vocabulary is by reading and taking an
interest in the words that other people
use.

In a couple of hours, though, she [the Titanic] began to go down more
rapidly. Then the fearful sight began. The people in the ship were just
beginning to realise how great their danger was. When the forward
part of the ship dropped suddenly at a faster rate, so that the upward
slope became marked, there was a sudden rush of passengers on all
the decks towards the stern. It was like a wave. We could see the great
black mass of people in the steerage sweeping to the rear part of the
boat and breaking through into the upper decks. At the distance of
about a mile we could distinguish everything through the night, which
was perfectly clear. We could make out the increasing excitement on
board the boat as the people, rushing to and fro, caused the deck
lights to disappear and reappear as they passed in front of them.

VOCABULARY

VOCABULARY FOR EFFECT
The words you use come from the vocabulary that you know and
can use confidently and comfortably. Some words – the, some, is,
what, for example – do not have the effect of other words such as
revolting, splendid, monster and eliminate. Here you are going to
look at the way writers choose words.

▶

A word means more than just its referend. For example, the word ‘grease’
denotes or refers to an oily material often used to lubricate machinery or carry
medication. Sometimes, however, the word is used to indicate distaste or
revulsion, allowing the word’s connotations, such as ‘nauseous’, ‘slimy’ and
‘sticky’, come into play.
Some words have positive or negative connotations, such as ‘success’ or
‘regrets’.
They talked all morning about her success.

GENERAL VOCABULARY

nauseous feeling sick

In the first sentence, the use of the word ‘success’ means that you know that
whatever she had done was approved of or appreciated as something positive.
Now she was left only with her regrets.
However, in the second sentence, the use of the word ‘regrets’ lets you know
that the subject now wishes that she had not done something which is seen
now in a negative light.

Once upon a time it was said that three trolls lived in a forest. Local
people lived in fear of them and avoided at night the twisting path that
wound its way between the trees. From time to time late-night travellers
would find themselves lost in the forest, alone and bewildered, and
they would imagine the sound of a foot snapping a twig or catch in the
corner of their eye something moving in the shadows.
These close encounters with the trolls were reported widely and fed
the imaginations of the locals. None of them realised that nobody had
ever been harmed in any way by these trolls, but that did not restrain

approach them warily in the forest and then, before they could
introduce themselves, their courage would fail and they would scuttle

its nest
Here the word ‘sapling’ provides a synonym for the tree. It helps to develop
the referend (tree) by supplying more detail and further connotations.

LANGUAGE FOR DIFFERENT EFFECTS
As you read you become aware of the different ways in which
language is used, and often form preferences. When you read
for a particular purpose, such as when looking for information
on a holiday destination, you quickly learn to recognise the sort
of material for which you are looking. This means that when you
write something you should aim to make clear the purpose of the
writing and the effect you want to achieve. It also helps to have
examined and understood how other writers achieve different
effects.

1 Read the following extract and consider what effects the writer is
trying to achieve. Look at some of the words used that indicate the
writer’s intentions. See if you can find and explain other ways in
which the language is used to achieve important effects.
I expect that you will have often heard warnings about the dangers to
your health of smoking. One of my teachers once described handling
the lungs of a victim of lung cancer; they resembled, he said, an old
leather rugby ball1 and they sat in his hands, hard and rough like a
large lump of coal2.
Giving advice to young people is often difficult for parents and
teachers3; it’s part of growing up, to put aside advice and warnings
from the older generation4 and to trust your own judgement. One of the
difficulties for young people, however, is “peer pressure,” the need to fit
in with their contemporaries, to meet their approval at least and, better
still sometimes, to impress them. Daring to smoke, especially when it
is forbidden, is part of this and it is probably as important for some
young people as any pleasure to be gained from supposedly enjoying5 a
cigarette while watching nervously in case a teacher appears6.

Look at the following sentence.
Now stop.
Which of the two words in this sentence is emphasised? What is the effect of
this?
If the order of the words is altered, something changes.
Stop now.
Instead of emphasising the action that is to be carried out, to stop, the
emphasis is now on the timing of that action – it must be amended now,
immediately.
The ordering of words in a sentence is important, particularly at the end of a
sentence or before a pause. There is a brief moment before you hear the next
word while the sound of the last word continues in your mind. Such a word is
emphasised and brought to your attention.
Look at the following sentences. One is the first sentence of the extract in
Activity 2, and the other is a re-ordered version. Consider the difference made
by re-ordering the words. Which ending do you think is the more effective?
Can you say why?
I expect that you will have often heard warnings about the dangers to your
health of smoking.
I expect that you will have often heard warnings about the dangers of

It may help you to analyse the phrases further by breaking them down into the
following smaller phrases:
◼◼ about the dangers to your health / of smoking
◼◼ about the dangers of smoking / to your health.
There are three key words: ‘dangers’, ‘health’ and ‘smoking’. Which of these
should be most closely connected? Perhaps it would help to put the three
words together like this: Smoking endangers health. Can you see now why
smoking was left at the end of the original sentence?

SENTENCES

SENTENCE TYPES
As you start to examine sentences it is important to remember
what makes a sentence. A sentence is the most basic part of the
written language and properly constructed sentences help you to
communicate effectively, whatever your purpose.
A sentence is built around finite verbs, or action words, which
indicate whether the action takes place in the past, present or
future and which have some indication of the agent, the person or
thing that carries out the action.

▶

BUILDING SENTENCES

SUBJECT VOCABULARY

clauses groups of words built around a
finite verb

First look at sentences in a mechanical way. Here is a simple sentence. It has
one verb, a main verb, took.
They took their sunglasses.
To this you can add something more:
They took their sunglasses and (they) enjoyed themselves.
The original sentence has become a compound sentence. Two simple
sentences have become joined by a conjunction: and. They have become two
coordinate clauses in a compound sentence. Each coordinate clause has a
main verb, in this case, took and enjoyed.
You can develop the sentence further:
They took their sunglasses and enjoyed themselves although it was raining.
To the compound sentence, with its two main verbs, a subordinate clause has
been added: although it was raining. This clause also contains a verb, was
raining; however, alone the clause, Although it was raining, makes incomplete
sense. Without a main clause you do not know what happened while it was
raining.
This clause has to be joined to the main sentence with a subordinating
conjunction, although. The sentence is now a complex sentence with two main
verbs and a subordinate verb.
They took their sunglasses and enjoyed themselves although it was raining.
You could link two of our components in other ways to form complex
sentences:
They took their sunglasses although it was raining.
Although it was raining they took their sunglasses.

▲ What is the main verb?

Each sentence here has a main clause and a subordinate clause.
Finally, look at another sentence:
He looked at the menu which was badly written.
A simple sentence, He looked at the menu, has become a main clause to
which a relative clause, which was badly written has been added. This relative
clause has been linked with a relative conjunction, which, to form another
complex sentence.

MINOR SENTENCES

KEY POINT

Words and phrases can be built up into
different types of sentences. By varying
the sentences you use, you help the
reader to stay engaged and strengthen
the effect of what you write.

You will sometimes find groups of words punctuated as if they were ordinary
sentences when they are not.
Good. A reaction to something
Over here! A demonstration, some information
The boyfriend I ditched last week. An answer to a question
In speech, such minor sentences are much more common and the listener can
usually ask for clarification if required. When you write it is better only to use
minor sentences in direct or quoted speech to show what is actually said.

Work in groups and match each of these opening sentences to the
explanations that follow.
i A newspaper article or an introduction to an item broadcast on
radio or television. It’s about an event that has already taken
place, but is being reported very soon afterwards. Notice that the
main point is conveyed early in the sentence to encourage us to
continue to pay attention.
ii An information slip, accompanying something that has been sent.
The sentence tells you what was done before the item was sent and
continues with an explanation that is designed to reassure you.
iii Travel writing. We are stopped by the drama of the opening which
is followed by a description of a geographical feature.
iv This account of the meeting in Brussels could appear in a book, a
history book perhaps. The sentence begins with an explanation of
why the event took place with the main point made briefly at the
end of the sentence, as if it is of less importance. The event, the
gathering, seems inevitable because there was a need to update

SENTENCES FOR EFFECTS
You have already seen the mechanical ways in which sentences
can be built up. Now look at the ways in which sentences achieve
their effects.

▶

Here’s a sentence from a book for young children.
The cat sat on the mat.
To see how this sentence achieves its effect, consider the point of the
sentence. What is it about? It’s about the cat sitting on the mat. That is all you
are told. This a periodic sentence, a few simple words followed by a full stop
(.) or, as it is called in American English, a period.
Let’s extend this sentence.
The cat sat on the mat and smiled.
This time the question is more subtle: what main point or points is the writer
making? You are told two main points.
A compound sentence is a sentence with more than one subject.

▼ PERIODIC SENTENCES
Write a few periodic sentences on individual slips of paper. Then work
as a group and see how many balanced sentences you can form by
joining the slips in pairs. You will probably need a few additional words.
Now look at a final development of the sentence.
With a huge grin on her face the cat sat on the mat while from next
door there came the sound of a dog digging its way under the fence.
What is the main point? The cat sat on the mat. All the other information
is of lesser importance and the main point is inserted among this
additional information. This is a ‘loose sentence’.
Each person in the group now writes one short periodic sentence. Pass
your sentence to another member of the group who should add further
information in order to make a balanced sentence. This should then be
passed onto the next member of the group to be turned into a loose
sentence.

▼ CONSTRUCTING VARIED SENTENCES
Work on your own and write three sentences as follows:
1 A periodic sentence including one of the following:
◼◼ an important piece of information
◼◼ a description of something that you find attractive
◼◼ something in which you believe very strongly.
2 A balanced sentence developing the idea from your first sentence in
two main points.
3 A loose sentence developing your idea further.
Then, in groups or as a class, listen to each other’s sets of sentences
read aloud and see how quickly you can identify the points they are
trying to make.

MOVING ON

KEY POINT

In a periodic sentence the main point
is found at the end, in a balanced
sentence there is more than one main
point and in a loose sentence the main
point is not at the end. You can use
this variety of sentence types to help
convey effectively the things you wish
to say in writing.

Look at two aspects of these examples: their length and their ordering.
It was late. He had left home early, caught the early bus, but the accident on
the main road meant he was alone now, after dark, in an area that he did not
know.
A short opening sentence establishes the time in a dramatic fashion and the
following sentence builds up to the next dramatic revelation, that the character
is alone. It is then that more drama is revealed: the darkness and his lack of
familiarity with the area.
These instructions should be followed carefully. Operatives who fail to do
this will be dealt with severely.
Here a simple sentence conveys information coupled with a warning at the end
where it is more noticeable, more emphatic. The warning tone is maintained in
the second sentence with its final warning that severe treatment is in prospect
for operatives who fail to head the instructions.
What would you do? You come home to find your house broken open, your
goods stolen, and all the plumbing smashed. Then the sergeant down at the
police station asks you to stay calm. Keep calm?
Confronted with a disaster someone asks why they should be expected to stay
calm. A short question holds us ready to respond. ‘You’ introduces the second
sentence, an attempt to lead the reader into imagining the writer’s feelings and
aspects of the disaster are listed to build up the force of the description. In
the next sentence, the tension is eased as we are told of the police sergeant’s
reaction, ready to hear the anger of the final, minor sentence, a simple
question that is all the more direct and challenging in its brevity.

Now add some description.
Our pets’ favourite sleeping place was the dog’s bed, nestled in a woollen
blanket next to the radiator.
And now some discussion.

COMMENTARIES

SENTENCES

41

Here are two passages for you to consider. The first one is measured, with
longer sentences.
The news had arrived and it was not good. For many people in the crowd
it was not bad news that they were expecting, but something better, the
prospect of better rations at least. Better still would be release from this
strange land and transport back to the border, if not all the way home.
However, once they had listened to the commandant’s words, there was
nothing for it but to make their way back to the barracks and try to get some
sleep.
The first, balanced sentence provides two items of information; the second
item provides a response to the first, a natural flow of ideas. The second
complex sentence contrasts this bad news with what they had perhaps been
hoping for, ‘something better’. This sentence is extended here with the phrase,
‘the prospect of better rations at least’, an important descriptive detail. The
idea of hope is also extended in a complex sentence where a group of three
items remind of this: release, transport to the border and transport home. The
first, subordinate clause in the final sentence kills off any prospect of hope and
leads to a main clause in which the inevitability of this is brought home to us
and the prisoners’ attempts to sleep bring closure to this episode.
The second passage is rather more dramatic.
The hand of the clock moves to the vertical, like a sentinel arriving at his
post. Now the moment has come. The referee looks around the pitch, catches
the eye of each linesman and then raises his whistle to his lips. Mahama’s
boot makes contact. There is the beginning of a roar. The ball reaches a
winger. He turns and sends the ball back towards the keeper who picks it up,
as if concerned for its safety. The ball bounces once in front of him and he
kicks it forwards. Razak it is now. He moves forward. Modi joins him. One
kick and the ball is bouncing in the net.
A longer opening sentence holds us at the moment before the game begins.
A short sentence hurries us towards the start, increasing the sense of drama,
but then we are held still as the next sentence, a compound one, lists the
referee’s three actions as he prepares to unleash the players. Three short,
simple sentences propel the action forward, then a longer, complex sentence
allows the goalkeeper to slow things down. The reader watches as the ball is
taken under his control and returned, a balanced sentence holding back the
excitement until a series of short sentences, pared of any surplus information,
conveys the essentials and the scoring of the goal provides a natural end to
the passage.

STRUCTURE

PRINCIPLES OF STRUCTURE
When a piece of writing is judged, or marked by examiners, the
purpose of the writing is considered, alongside the accuracy and
clarity of the writing and with an overall sense of the writing’s
effectiveness.
Here you are going to consider the way that sentences and
paragraphs are organised so that the structure of the writing is
enhanced and made more effective.

▶

Read the following sentence.
Zlatan, look out!
There is an urgent call to one person here, the first name we hear: Zlatan. The
most important word here is placed at the start of the sentence. However, now
look at the following sentence:
After school I need to speak to you, Zlatan.
Here a teacher is making an announcement and wants all the class to listen
until the name of the student concerned is revealed at the end of the sentence.
If you ask what a sentence is about, you can identify its subject. The subject of
each of these sentences has been highlighted.
1 The ice cream was hidden in the freezer.
2 Hidden in the freezer was the ice cream.
3 The ice cream, which her brother had hidden in the freezer, was
discovered.
4 Hidden in the freezer, which had been turned off, was the ice cream.
Those parts of the sentence that are not the subject are called the predicate.
The predicate can be discovered by asking the question, ‘What are we told
about the subject of the sentence?’
Apply this question to the four sentences above.

STAGES IN A PIECE OF WRITING

STRUCTURE

43

The principle of steps in writing applies to any piece of writing that you do.
Whether it is a brief email, a set of instructions for a piece of machinery, a text
book or a novel, it will require an introduction, a middle section and an ending.

▼ STAGE TRANSITION
Work with a partner and identify the key words that show the transition
from introduction, to mid-section, to the ending in the paragraph that
follows.

KEY POINT

You have looked at how sentences can
have an introduction, a middle section
and an ending. The same is true of
a more substantial piece of writing,
including with books.

The Turkish teacher met them at the airport and introduced her
husband, a company lawyer. Soon they were hurrying along the
freeway and then there was a turning off, followed by miles bumping
along worn back roads. For a while he wondered just what he had let
himself in for and then the car slowed. Away from the road there was
a large timber house, set in a large garden. Then he sighed with relief
for this was to be his home for the next six weeks.
Now use those same words in a paragraph of your own construction,
to show shifts from the introduction, to the middle section, to the
conclusion.

▼ BREAKING DOWN STORIES
Work with a partner and identify any story that you know and that you
think your classmates will know. It could be a television drama, a film
you have watched, a story that you have read or a story that was read
to you. Describe the three stages of the story, the introduction, the
middle section and the ending, in three sentences.
Before you start, here is an example of three sentences that outline a
well-known story (The Cruel Sea by Nicholas Montsarrat) in the same
way.
We meet Ericson, the captain of both the boats involved in the story,
in a naval dockyard where the first of his two commands is still in the
hands of the builders. Ericson’s career, as captain of a warship that is
sunk, and of another warship that survives the war, leads us through
five years of naval warfare in what came to be known as The Battle of
the Atlantic. At the end of this battle, Ericson finds himself in charge
of captured submarines which are now incapable of threatening allied
shipping any more.

PARAGRAPHING FOR EFFECT
There are no mechanical rules about the size or length of
sentences or paragraphs, nor about the number of lines or words

you best organise sentences and paragraphs so that they are as
clear as possible?
You have already looked at ideas that link sentences. Now,

firstly, maintain contact with what you have already written and,
secondly, develop ideas, sometimes with new material, new
ideas and new directions.

The woman offered him another cup of tea. She had been very friendly
since he had stepped into the house. The room seemed all right and
now there was another cup of tea. There was something slightly odd
about the taste, not enough to worry him and, anyway, he wanted
to find out what the rent would be. While she waited for his answer
she glanced down at the newspaper and folded it away, hastily, out of
sight, behind one of the cushions.
There was a knock at the front door. The woman got up and went
into the hall to see who it was and he could hear a conversation get
under way. From behind the cushion he retrieved the newspaper and
read the headline: Missing students - poisoner suspected. He took
another sip of his tea. This time he screwed up his face and put down
the cup. From one side he picked up his coat and stood up.

▶▶ What is new in the second paragraph?
▶▶ What changes about the young man in the second paragraph?
There is a balance in these two paragraphs. You learn why the young
man has come to the house and that information needs no further
development. The hints about the tea in the first paragraph prepare you
for the dramatic newspaper headline revealed in the second paragraph.

LINKING IDEAS

This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ organise the flow of ideas to
maximise their effect.

Good writing flows and is easy to read. Here you will see how a
writer can organise the flow of ideas to maximise their effect.

UNDERSTANDING HOW IDEAS LINK
TOGETHER

Read this article about Nevil Shute, a British author in 20th century. His bestknown novel was A Town Like Alice.
Not many people1 who enjoyed Shute’s novels realised that he had started out
as an engineer in the early days of aero-engineering after the First World War,
not with aeroplanes, but with airships2. It was while he was working as an
engineer that he began to write3.
Although well-qualified4, with an engineering degree from Oxford University,
Shute, whose full name was Nevil Shute Norway was a practical man5,
interested in the ways that people from different backgrounds could get along
well. In A Town like Alice, a brief encounter during the Second World War
between a brash Australian prisoner of war and an English girl who had
also been taken prisoner by the Japanese, developed into a romance as the
Australian travels to England after the war to find the woman he had known
as Mrs Bong6.
It is in his non-fiction7, his auto-biography, Slide Rule, that we learn how to
build an air-ship and he describes the ladder-way inside the craft8 that enables
engineers to climb out onto the top of the balloon while it is flying to sit and
chat9. While the engineers hold on to a safety rope, passengers in the cabin
slung below the balloon travel in comparative safety10. Shute also wrote
authoritatively about the economics of air-ship construction and the politics
that drove a government-controlled industry to compete with a private one11.
In this book we also learn of12 his terrible sadness in his early teens when his
older brother was killed in the trenches of the First World War13, as a result of
the enemy’s tunnelling under the British trenches and packing the space with
high explosive. Shute watched as his brother, Fred, took two weeks to die in
hospital in France; Shute’s parents, unlike most people, were in a position
to drive across France to visit their dying son. When Shute eventually wrote
about this he was forty and still missing his brother terribly14.

provided by the information that he worked, not with aeroplanes, which
is what we expect of aeronautical engineers, but with airships. It might

lead you from one idea to the next, so that you follow the writer and

KEY POINT

Punctuate the ends of sentences
clearly so that they are easily read and
easily understood.

Work on your own and punctuate the following passage. If you cannot
read the passage aloud try to imagine the sound of your voice as you
read it. Remember, each sentence must have at least one main verb.
it was night over the hill they could see the stars they had been told of
the dangers of the area but they had decided to continue anyway soon
they reached the first of the houses where the street took a sharp turn
to the right soon they would be back home

Questions must be finished with a question mark. They are formed in two
ways. They may be formed with auxiliary verbs such as would, should, do,
does, and so on. For example; Should we leave? or Does he take sugar?
Another way of forming questions involves the reversal of the subject/verb
order in a statement. For example, Is it theirs? This form of question may
include question words such as why, what, where, who, whom and how. For
example, How do you like your coffee?
Exclamation marks can be used to represent strong emotions, emphasise
points or suggest volume. They should be used sparingly so as to not lessen
their impact.

This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand that a comma is
used to indicate a pause within
a sentence.

PUNCTUATION AND SPELLING

49

COMMAS
Commas are essential for dictating the way in which sentences
are read, spoken and understood. A single comma can change
the entire meaning of a sentence.

Commas do the following:
◼◼ indicate a pause, to leave clear a main clause:
While it was raining, they watched a film.
◼◼ separate items in a list:
For breakfast he ate cereal, toast, baked beans and two apples.
◼◼ clarify meaning by separating ideas:
His friend who had black hair was found with him. (It was his friend
with black hair who was found with him, not one of his other friends.)
His friend, who had black hair, was found with. (This friend just
happened to have black hair.)
◼◼ open and close direct speech:
‘Come in,’ said the doctor, ‘do sit down.’ The patient made himself
comfortable and replied, ‘good to see you, doctor.’
‘You know,’ said the doctor, ‘it’s a good job you made this appointment.’
Notice how the actual words that are spoken are enclosed in speech
marks, or inverted commas.
Look at this sentence:
The River Niger rises in the north of Nigeria, which takes its name from
the river, to the north of Lake Oguta, and makes its way southwards
towards the delta and out into the Gulf of Guinea.
The first and second commas separate information about the origin
of Nigeria’s name and the second and third commas separate further
information, about the place where the river rises. These three commas
enclose additional information that does not impede the main flow of
the sentence. Without this information the main sections of the sentence
would still flow together.
The River Niger rises to the north of Lake Oguta and makes its way
southwards towards the delta and out into the Gulf of Guinea.

WRITING SKILLS

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand how apostrophes
are used.

PUNCTUATION AND SPELLING

APOSTROPHES
Apostrophes have two functions. They indicate the omission of
one or more letters and, usually with the letter s, they indicate
possession, meaning that something belongs to someone or
something else. Like other punctuation marks, if they are used
correctly, they help to make clear to the reader what the writer
intended.

Read both these sentences aloud.
It’s going to be a long night and there’s nowhere to go.
It is going to be a long night and there is nowhere to go.
When you read the second sentence you have to make just a little more effort
to read It is and there is. In speech people usually prefer to elide the i in is.
That means the sound is suppressed or glided over for the sake of ease and
speed. In writing, however, this is often seen as informal in style.
You can do this with other letters and, so long as you use the apostrophe, this
will be clear to the reader. Here is another example.
We haven’t a penny between us but she’s got plenty.
This time the o and ha sounds have been missed.
When it is possession that is to be indicated, the apostrophe usually appears
before the s if the subject is singular and afterwards if the subject is plural.
Helen’s mother hid all her brothers’ bicycles.
With words that end in s, or words that do not take an s to show the plural
there are two ways to punctuate possession, for example, Chris’ bike and the
children’s clothes. Alternatively, an additional ’s can be added to names ending
with an s: Chris’s bike. However, ensure that you remain consistent by only
following one of these rules.
Finally, you have to remember Its and It’s. When you omit the apostrophe in its,
it is possessive. It’s is a contraction of it is.

WRITING SKILLS

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand how to use
different punctuation marks.

COLONS

PUNCTUATION AND SPELLING

COLONS, SEMI-COLONS, DASHES, BRACKET, ELLIPSES
There is a range of different punctuation marks, each capable
of achieving a particular effect or changing the meaning of a
sentence. Being able to use them all will ensure your writing is
varied and engaging.

Colons are used to introduce evidence or examples.
They could see what was stopping the car: a brick wedged under the tyre.

▶▶ Write three sentences using a colon like this.
SEMI-COLONS

Semi-colons are used to join closely related sentences or separate long items
in a list.
It was too late; slowly he raised his hands.
They were all there; Billy who had broken his leg last year; Charlie who had
rescued him, although he too had been wounded; and the dog.

▶▶ Write two sentences following the first example and two following the
second one.
DASHES

Dashes are used to signal clearly the insertion of non-essential material into a
sentence. Their purpose could be to add emphasis, to interrupt or to indicate
an abrupt change of thought.
They were all there – two men and a dog – and she realised that the police
would have to be called.

▶▶ Write two sentences following the pattern of this example.
BRACKETS

Brackets are used to add additional material about a preceding item.
Remember that, unlike dashes, brackets must be used in pairs.
Kevin (lead singer) and Sharon were the band’s best performers.

▶▶ Insert information in brackets about the asterisked words in the sentence
that follows.
‘Their guide* who had joined them at the airport helped two of them* to
carry their bags.’

ELLIPSES

KEY POINT

Remember that each of these
punctuation marks has a distinctive
function.

Ellipses are used where a word is omitted and are made up of three dots (like
full stops). It’s most useful in direct speech; when you speak, you are more
likely to pause or break off in mid-sentence.
He paused. ‘I don’t think I’m …’ With that he turned away.
‘If you don’t stop that I’ll, I’ll …’ Before she could finish they had drowned
her in laughter.

▶▶ Work with a partner and construct two dialogues between two or more
characters. Each of you should write the first line of a dialogue, then pass it
to your partner who should write the second line. Continue like this until you
have written at least ten lines.

WRITING SKILLS

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ avoid common spelling errors.

PUNCTUATION AND SPELLING

COMMON SPELLING ERRORS
It is easy to find lists of commonly misspelt words on the internet.
These sites often provide reminders for some spellings and
suggest that you make a list of the words that you find difficult to
spell.
Correct spelling is something that depends on your visual memory so reading
will help. You should also try to find ways of remembering something about the
word, for example, stationary and stationery.
Where a is the final vowel the word means not moving or stopped. Think of
stopped as arrested, a word which begins with an a.
Where e is the final vowel the word refers to envelopes and writing paper

▲ Similar words, very different things

SUBJECT VOCABULARY

mnemonic a device used to aid memory –
usually in the form of a saying or rhyme

KEY POINT

Avoiding spelling mistakes will make
your writing much more effective and
engaging

Another way to help yourself to remember difficult spellings is to look closely
at the word, jotted down perhaps on a scrap of paper, and try to memorise it.
Then cover up the word while you try to write it down accurately. Repeat this
process if necessary. (Here’s another difficult word, necessary. Remember,
shirts are necessary – one collar and two sleeves.)
Words that contain e and i together are sometimes easier to spell if you
remember the following mnemonic:
i before e, except after c, unless the sound matches weigh.
So you have: yield, receive, sleigh. There are exceptions such as seize.
Particularly important words that you should make an effort to spell correctly
include:
accompany
agreeable
anxious
applaud

WRITING SKILLS

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ start checking your writing
automatically.

TIPS TO REMEMBER

▲ Listening to how your writing reads is almost
as important as reading it thoroughly when
checking your work

KEY POINT

Remember that your aim should
always be to write clearly, accurately
and effectively. As you write ask
yourself, is this clear, is this accurate,
will this be effective when someone
else reads it?

PUNCTUATION AND SPELLING

IMPROVE YOUR WRITING
Like any practical activity, writing will improve with practice.
Write regularly, at least ten minutes a day and always check your
writing as you go. It’s a good idea to check each paragraph as
you proceed and that way you will also have a second look at
your ideas and an opportunity to consider again how you will lead
your ideas into the next paragraph.
Spelling, punctuation and grammar must all come together when
you write. In practice you have been able to deal with them
separately, but when you write you have to cope with all of them
at once.
◼◼ Allow your hearing (or the imagined sound of reading) to check grammar
and punctuation.
◼◼ Allow your sight to check spelling. If you are typing, don't rely on spell
checkers.
◼◼ When you edit a piece of writing you have to consider the way words are
used and put together so that you can correct errors. At the same time,
you must consider the ideas that are conveyed and whether they could
have been clearer and better organised.
Remember that you must do the following:
>> Begin a sentence with a capital letter. A capital letter marks clearly
the start of a new sentence. Capital letters must also be used to
mark proper nouns and all components of a proper noun, such as
Mohammed, Singapore and Hong Kong Airport.
>> Stop sentences clearly with a full stop, a question mark or an
exclamation mark. Use these punctuation marks in direct speech to
mark the end of a spoken sentence.
>> Use commas for pauses and lists, as well as for clarifying information
and in direct speech. Here the commas indicate the pauses as we
read, to help indicate the words that are actually spoken.
Marie uttered the words, ‘You fool!’ She swallowed hard before continuing.
‘What do you think you’re doing?’ She raised her mobile. ‘The police,’ she
said, ‘the police will like this when I send it.’
When you want to include additional information without interrupting the flow
of the sentence you must choose between dashes and brackets:
>> Dashes lead the eye to the next word so that the additional information
can be easily taken in as we read on. For example, ‘It was light – the
sort of morning that calls to early risers – so staying in bed seemed
sinful.’
>> Brackets allow the insertion of shorter, more practical items of
information. For example, ‘Take out the flour (wholemeal, remember)
and weigh out 200 grammes.’

PROOF-READING: MECHANICAL
ACCURACY

PUNCTUATION AND SPELLING

PROOF-READING, CHECKING AND EDITING
There are two important aspects of checking what has been written:
Proof-reading: marking errors in a draft
Editing: looking for opportunities to modify and improve the material
When proof-reading, ask yourself the following questions.

▶▶ Are words spelt and ordered correctly?
▶▶ Are words changed where necessary so that they work together?
▶▶ Do the words flow when read out loud? If you are unable to read aloud, try
imagining reading aloud instead.
▶▶ Have you double checked?

Across the river he could see the old railway track which had been on
the sea-wall. No trains had been seen there for half a century but now
a bunch of men who gathered in the Railway Arms, a well-known
public house, had decided to campaign for its restoration. One of his
neighbours, now in his eighties, remembered the sound of the whistle
from the midday train which was his signal to stop work in the fields
and go home for lunch.
KEY POINT

Language is firstly a spoken matter,
something understood through hearing
before reading or writing. One of the
best ways of checking written material
is to read it aloud.
When checking your work, you should try
to imagine the sound of a voice reading
it aloud. Remember that the purpose of
writing accurately is to make it easy for
someone to read it and understand it
with little effort. This is what you should
check for when proof-reading and editing
a piece of writing, whether it is your own
or someone else’s.

Proofreading and editing are essential to any form of writing. Even the
best ideas or most carefully thought out argument can benefit from these
processes, ensuring they are as engaging and effective as possible. Spelling
mistakes, grammatical errors or poorly constructed sentences can greatly
lessen the impact of a piece of writing, so it is important to carefully check
your work and ensure it is of the best possible quality.

This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand some of the

and prepare you to answer

the authors gives their own account.
The ‘truth’ of their account can be
questioned.

NON-FICTION TEXTS

TYPES OF TEXT
The specification lists examples of the possible types of text that
may appear in Paper 1:
◼◼ biography or autobiography
◼◼ obituaries
◼◼ speeches
◼◼ newspaper or magazine
articles

◼◼ travel writing
◼◼ diaries or letters
◼◼ reviews
◼◼ reference books.
▶

The texts that you will write about in Paper 1 will be non-fiction. Fiction
describes scenes imagined (at least partly) by the writer. Non-fiction writing
does the opposite: it is about things that really happened, although we cannot
rely on all non-fiction to be accurate.
In an autobiography, the writer describes his or her own life. However, some
events may not have been remembered accurately, or some events may be
exaggerated for effect, perhaps to show the writer as positively as possible.
Some autobiographies may be considered more like fiction than non-fiction by
their readers because they are not very accurate.
A biography is the life story of a famous or interesting person, whether from
history or from the present day. Today, there are also ‘authorised biographies’,
in which the subject of the biography gives the writer specific legal permission
to produce the biography. The subject can decide which events are included
or omitted and how the writer describes them.
Another form of autobiographical writing is the diary or journal, or the modern
equivalent, the blog (short for ‘web log’). For example, The Diary of a Young
Girl by Anne Frank contains important factual material about her daily life
during the German occupation of the Netherlands. It is therefore more than just
a personal account. (However, not all diaries set out to be accurate or truthful.
Many diaries have other purposes, such as to entertain, to give personal views
and to communicate with friends.
News reports may appear in newspapers or magazines. News is expected
to be objective, or unbiased, and based on clear evidence. As readers, we
want to know whether a reporter is trying to present the material in a particular
way because of their own opinions on the topic. However, some newspaper
and magazine articles are undoubtedly biased. In all forms of non-fiction text,
therefore, the question of truth and accuracy really matters. This means that
part of the reader’s analysis should include looking for any examples of bias or
opinion that is not supported by evidence.
Feature articles are usually about a topic of interest to a large number of
readers: they can be about almost anything, from family matters to global
politics. They are usually based on research. Opinion or comment pieces will
contain factual evidence and explanation, but aim to argue a case about a
topic of general interest.
An obituary is a newspaper article, found most frequently in broadsheet
newspapers, about a remarkable or well-known person who has just died. Its
length depends on the fame or significance of the subject.

The wind continued to rise during the first few days, and by the third I was
changing down to the storm jib on the foredeck, and was thrown off my
feet before cracking my head hard against the inner forestay rod, resulting
in an instant lump and a strange nausea. Soon afterwards, the weather front
passed, only to bring even stronger 55-knot gusts in a steady 45-knot wind.
It was an unreal, crazy situation: just trying to hang on inside the boat took
every ounce of strength. Food was hurled around the cabin along with water
containers and spares, while I tried to scrape things up and put them back in
the boxes. My hands stung, my eye was swollen, and my wrists were already
covered in open sores. ….
Dawn brought some respite. My body temperature warmed after the freezing
night, but if I sweated through the physical exertion of a sail change, when I
stopped, I’d once again cool to a shiver. Sleep proved virtually impossible –
just snatched ten-minute bursts ended by the cold.

Just two days later conditions began to worsen again. Doing anything
was not only difficult but painful. My hands were red-raw and swollen,
and my head was aching – even more so when the freezing water washed
breathtakingly over it each time I went forward to change sails. Shifting the
sails was hard, brutal work. Whenever it was time to change one I would
pull it forward, clipping myself on and hanging on for dear life. Waves would
continuously power down the side-decks, often washing me and the sail back
a couple of metres, and I had to hang on and tighten my grip on the sail tie
even further. I would often cry out loud as I dragged the sail along; it was
one way of letting out some of that frustration and of finding the strength to
do it…
After a week things finally began to calm, and with my legs red-hot and sore,

GENERAL VOCABULARY

were forced to go to separate schools, live

NON-FICTION TEXTS

61

An obituary is a very abbreviated biographical sketch of a remarkable person
in the form of a newspaper article. These are usually published in newspapers
shortly after their death has been announced. The length of obituaries varies,
but an important world leader is likely to get a full page. Here are extracts
from two examples: one for Nelson Mandela, who after years of imprisonment
eventually became president of post-apartheid South Africa, and the other
for David Bowie, the famous musician. Both are taken from The Guardian
newspaper.

▼ ‘NELSON MANDELA OBITUARY’, FROM THE GUARDIAN
Mandela greatly enjoyed university, particularly boxing and athletics, and,
on the strength of his first-year studies in English, anthropology, politics,
native administration and Roman-Dutch law, nursed an ambition to become
a civil servant and interpreter – about as high a position as a black man
might aspire to in those days. But his ambition seemed to be crushed when,
in 1940, in his second year, as a member of the student representative
council he was expelled for his part in a rebellion over poor quality food. He
returned to Mqhekezweni to find another potential disaster – an arranged
marriage was being planned for him.
▲ Nelson Mandela

▼ ‘DAVID BOWIE OBITUARY’, FROM THE GUARDIAN
In July 1969 Bowie released Space Oddity, the song that would give him his
initial commercial breakthrough. Timed to coincide with the Apollo 11 moon
landing, it was a top five UK hit. The accompanying album was originally
called Man of Words / Man of Music, but was later reissued as Space Oddity.
The following year was a momentous one for Bowie. His brother Terry was
committed to a psychiatric institution (and would kill himself in 1985), and
his father died. In March, Bowie married Angela Barnett, an art student.
He dumped Pitt [his manager] and recruited the driven and aggressive Tony
DeFries, prompting Pitt to sue successfully for compensation. Artistically,
Bowie was powering ahead. The Man Who Sold the World was released in
the US in late 1970 and in the UK the following year under Bowie’s new deal
with RCA Victor, and with its daring songwriting and broody, hard-rock
sound, it was the first album to do full justice to his writing and performing
gifts.

SPEECHES

▲ Martin Luther King at the March in
Washington rally in August 1963.

Speeches can be given for many different reasons. Lawyers make speeches
in court for the defence or the prosecution. People make speeches in debates
or after formal dinners to entertain an audience. However, the most famous
speeches are those made by politicians as part of campaigns. The purpose
of such speeches is often to rally supporters and give listeners a sense of
purpose and inspiration.
The following speech was made by the American civil rights campaigner,
Martin Luther King Junior, who was later assassinated for his beliefs and his
work on behalf of black Americans.
As you read the speech, think about how Martin Luther King shows his
listeners that he is fighting for a better and fairer society in America, using
techniques such as:
◼◼ repetition of key words
◼◼ repetition of the beginning of sentences
◼◼ reference to particular individuals
◼◼ use of geographical references (i.e. different parts of the United States)
◼◼ describing the difficulties black people have faced over the years
◼◼ the idea of bringing all people together
◼◼ the use of words from a patriotic song.

And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.
Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.
Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania……
Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
From every mountainside, let freedom ring.

KEY POINT

Look at the way an author has used
the technical devices of language
to persuade the reader of a certain
viewpoint.

And when this happens, when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will
be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white
men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands
and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:
Free at last! Free at last!
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!

HINT

Although you will be given credit for
knowing and identifying techniques, many
more marks go to good explanations of
their effects, of why they are used, than
to mere technique-spotting.

The art of persuasive writing and speaking is called rhetoric. Rhetorical
devices include many techniques used in poetry, since they can make all
kinds of writing more memorable. These techniques include alliteration,
onomatopoeia, figurative language (similes, metaphors and personification),
emotive language and word choices.

NON-FICTION TEXTS

Many people express their most personal thoughts about their lives in writing
that is less planned and more informal than an autobiography. This can be
done either in a diary that they write regularly – often to an imaginary friend,
such as Anne Frank’s ‘Kitty’ – or in a letter to someone close: a friend, a
lover or a relative. This means that the perspective of diaries and letters is
personal, and many writers of diaries and letters did not originally intend them
to be published. Remember that someone’s thoughts and feelings can be an
important part of a non-fiction text, just like in fiction.
Some of the most powerful diaries and letters that have been published give
us a remarkable understanding of the suffering of individuals in wartime. Anne
Frank’s diary, published as The Diary of a Young Girl, gives us a remarkable
understanding of the suffering of individuals in wartime. Anne was a Dutch
teenager who kept a diary over a period of two years during the Second World
War. As she and her family were Jewish, they hid from the Nazis in a house
in Amsterdam. The diary entries ended when the Frank family was eventually
found and arrested. Anne was sent to a concentration camp, where she died.
The following extract comes from the early months of Anne’s period in hiding.

▼ THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL BY ANNE FRANK
‘Paper has more patience than people.’ I thought of this saying on one of
those days when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with
my chin in my hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or
go out. I finally stayed where I was, brooding. Yes, paper does have more
patience, and since I’m not planning to let anyone else read this stiff-backed
notebook grandly referred to as a ‘diary’, unless I should ever find a real
friend, it probably won’t make a bit of difference.
Now I’m back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first
place: I don’t have a friend.

home Is it surprising to find that a diary is
preoccupied with family and friends?
time Notice the informal register here.

Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen-year-old
girl is completely alone in the world. And I’m not. I have loving parents and
a sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends.
I have a throng of admirers who can’t keep their adoring eyes off me and
who sometimes have to resort to using a broken pocket mirror to try and
catch a glimpse of me in the classroom. I have a family, loving aunts and a
good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything, except my one true
friend. All I think about when I’m with friends is having a good time. I can’t
bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don’t
seem to be able to get any closer, and that’s the problem. Maybe it’s my fault
that we don’t confide in each other. In any case, that’s just how things are,
and unfortunately they’re not liable to change. This is why I’ve started the
diary.

STUDENT ANSWER TO QUESTION 2
The statement that Anne does not have a friend is explored in an
interesting way in the final paragraph. Anne distinguishes in quite a
mature way between having a loving family and many people who
admire her, although this may be ironic, and having someone in
whom she can really confide. She recognises that her life is going
to be extremely difficult, and that she risks feeling isolated from the
community. She regrets the superficial relationship that she has with her
friends, and is looking for some deeper and more trusting relationship.

Vera Brittain was a writer who worked as a nurse during the First World War.
Her letters, sent to her friends, family and fiancé from her nursing posts, are a
powerful record of traumatic wartime experiences. The following extract comes
from a letter that she wrote to her family, giving her honest views about the
things that she saw and did as a nurse to injured soldiers.

Possibly acute surgical is the heaviest type of work there is, I think, more
wearing than anything else on earth. You are kept on the go the whole time
but in the end there seems to be nothing definite to show for it – except that
one or two are still alive that might otherwise have been dead. The hospital is
very heavy now… – the convoys keep coming down, two or three a night…
Sometimes in the middle of the night we have to turn people out of bed and
make them sleep on the floor to make room for the more seriously ill ones
who have come down from the line. We have heaps of gassed cases at present
who came in a day or two ago; there are 10 in this ward alone. I wish those

early stages – could see the poor things all burnt and blistered all over with
great mustard-coloured blisters, with blind eyes – sometimes temporarily,
sometimes permanently – all sticky and stuck together, and always fighting
for breath, their voices a whisper, saying their throats are closing and they
know they will choke.
The strain is very, very great. The enemy is within shelling distance – refugee
sisters crowding in with nerves all awry – bright moonlight, and aeroplanes
carrying machine guns – ambulance trains jolting into the siding, all day, all
night – gassed men on stretchers clawing the air – dying men reeking with
mud and foul green stained bandages, shrieking and writhing in a grotesque
travesty of manhood – dead men with fixed empty eyes and shiny yellow
faces.

TRAVEL WRITING

A lot of writing, both fiction and non-fiction, deals with travel. When it is nonfiction, travel writing is generally autobiographical in form. Travel writers usually
try to record their actual experiences. Ask yourself a series of questions about
the writing:
◼◼ Does the writer bring the events to life, so that you can really imagine the
people, and picture the place and the way of life there? How do they do
this?
◼◼ What attitudes does the writer show towards the places visited? Are there
feelings of amazement, delight, humour or sadness?
◼◼ Why is the writer telling you about his or her travels? Is it to make you want
to visit the place? To entertain you? To enable you to experience places
and people that you may never be able to visit personally?
◼◼ Does the writer bring out the ways in which customs, clothing, food or
traditions differ from those you are used to?
The following two extracts are about the writers’ experiences in different
places: one is describing Mongolia, while the other is describing Africa.
In Mongolian Wedding, Stanley Stewart sees the beauty and fun of the events
he watches and wishes to share his enjoyment with the reader, by bringing
events to life as vividly as he can. As you read the passage, think about:
◼◼ whether this wedding seems like weddings that you have witnessed
◼◼ how the writer felt as someone not used to these traditions
◼◼ signs that, at times, he found the celebrations very amusing
◼◼ the way that presents a detailed picture of events.

▼ MONGOLIAN WEDDING BY STANLEY STEWART
Throughout the evening people came to warn me about themselves. They
sat on the grass outside my tent, unburdening themselves with pre-emptive
confessions. The following day would be difficult, they said. Weddings
were boisterous occasions. People became unpredictable. They counselled
me about particular individuals, then admitted that they themselves could
be as bad as the next fellow. I would be wise to get away early before
things got out of hand.

arrayed Arranged.
arkhi A clear spirit distilled from milk.
lavish Very generous.
dishevelled Disordered, disarranged.
terra firma [Latin] Solid ground.
tailgate The back end of the truck.

In the morning the groom and his supporters, a party of about seven or
eight relations, set off to fetch the bride from her ger, which lay some 15
miles away. An old Russian truck, the equivalent of the wedding Rolls,
had been specially hired for the occasion.
When they arrived the groom would be obliged to search for his bride
who by tradition must hide from him. It would not be too difficult. The
tradition is that she hides under a bed in the neighbouring ger. While we
waited for their return we were given breakfast in the newlyweds’ ger.
Over the past weeks it had been lovingly prepared by relations. It was like
a show ger from Ideal Gers… Biscuits, slabs of white cheese and boiled
sweets had been arrayed on every surface in dizzy tiers like wedding
cakes. On a low stool stood a mountainous plate of sheep parts, with the
favoured cut, the great fatty tail, like a grey glacier on its summit.
Younger sisters hustled in and out making last-minute preparations. While
we were at breakfast the first lookouts were posted to watch for the return
of the truck bearing the wedding party from the bride’s camp. By midafternoon we were still waiting. Apparently a wedding breakfast would
have been given to the groom and his accompanying party at the bride’s
camp, and complicated calculations were now performed concerning
the number of miles to the bride’s ger, divided by the speed of the truck
combined with the probable duration of the breakfast, and finally
multiplied by the estimated consumption of arkhi.
At four o’clock a spiral of dust finally appeared beyond a distant ridge.
When the truck drew up in front of the wedding ger, it was clear that
the lavish hospitality of the bride’s camp had been the cause of the delay.
The back of the truck was crammed with wedding guests in such a state
of dishevelled merriment that we had some difficulty persuading them to
disembark. The bride’s mother, apparently convinced that they were at
the wrong ger, required four men to convey her to terra firma. The bride’s
elder sister, shrugging off all assistance, fell headfirst from the tailgate,
bounced twice and came to rest, smiling, against a door post.

▼ FROM A PASSAGE TO AFRICA BY GEORGE ALAGIAH
I was in a little hamlet just outside Gufgaduud, a village in the back of
beyond… In the ghoulish manner of journalists on the hunt for the most
striking pictures, my cameraman and I tramped from one hut to another.
What might have appalled us when we’d started our trip just a few days
before no longer impressed us much.

KEY POINT

Include details of the circumstances
and events. You should not try to
summarise the whole extract, but focus
on key moments and explain why you
think the writer included these details.

There was Amina Abdirahman, who had gone out that morning in search
of wild, edible roots, leaving her two young girls lying on the dirt floor
of their hut. They had been sick for days, and were reaching the final,
enervating stages of terminal hunger. Habiba was ten years old and her
sister, Ayaan, was nine. By the time Amina returned, she had only one
daughter. Habiba had died. No rage, no whimpering, just a passing away –
that simple, frictionless, motionless deliverance from a state of half-life to
death itself. It was, as I said at the time in my dispatch, a vision of ‘famine
away from the headlines, a famine of quiet suffering and lonely death’.

There was the old woman who lay in her hut, abandoned by relations
who were too weak to carry her on their journey to find food. It was the
smell that drew me to her doorway: the smell of decaying flesh. Where
her shinbone should have been there was a festering wound the size of
my hand. She’d been shot in the leg as the retreating army of the deposed
dictator took revenge on whoever it found in its way. The shattered leg
had fused into the gentle V-shape of a boomerang. It was rotting; she was
rotting. You could see it in her sick, yellow eyes and smell it in the putrid
air she recycled with every struggling breath she took.

Reading newspapers or magazines fairly regularly will not only improve your

exist in online versions, which makes them much easier to access.
Articles come in various types and lengths. They can be about anything
of general current interest, from politics and economics to shopping and
education. Articles may or may not express strong views or come to definite
conclusions about the topic, but they usually inform us of developments, make
us aware of things of interest and warn us of dangers. The following articles do
express opinions meaning that they are known as ‘opinion pieces’. In opinion
pieces, it is particularly important that the views are well argued and backed
up by evidence.

▼ ‘ SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN
YOU THINK’ BY MIKE ELGAN FOR COMPUTER WORLD
Social networks are massively addictive. Most people I know check and
interact on social sites constantly throughout the day. And they have no idea
how much actual time they spend on social media.

▲ Changing social habits are a fertile subject
for writers

reversion Returning to something.

If you’re a social media addict, and your addiction is getting worse, there’s
a reason for that: Most of the major social network companies, as well as
social content creators, are working hard every day to make their networks
so addictive that you can’t resist them.
Cornell Information Science published research earlier this month that
looked at (among other things) the difficulty some people have in quitting
Facebook and other social networks. They even have a label for the failure to
quit: ‘social media reversion.’
The study is interesting because they revealed the difficulty people have
quitting Facebook because of addiction. Participants intended to quit, wanted
to quit and believed they could quit (for 99 days), but many couldn’t make
more than a few days.
The addictive aspect of social networking is associated with FOMO – fear of
missing out. Everyone is on Facebook. They’re posting things, sharing news
and content and talking to each other 24/7.

HINT

When you are thinking about structure,
look at the paragraphs and try to say what
the main idea is for each one. For example,
in paragraph 1, it is that social media are
addictive; in paragraph 2, it is that social
media companies deliberately make
their social networks addictive. Then ask
yourself why some paragraphs are longer
and where the writer brings in evidence.
Finally, consider why the last paragraph is
so short.

The network effect itself is addicting, according to Instagram software
engineer Greg Hochmuth, ‘A network effect is the idea that any network
becomes more valuable as more people connect to that network. The phone
system is the best example of this phenomenon – you have to have a phone
because everybody else has a phone.
In the world of social networking, Facebook benefits most from network
effect. Facebook happened to be the top social network when social
networking busted out as a mainstream activity. Now, everybody’s on
Facebook because everybody’s on Facebook. And even people who don’t like
the social network use it anyway, because that’s where their family, friends
and colleagues are – and because of addiction.
The contribution of network effect to the addictive quality of web sites is
accidental. But social sites are also addictive by design.

‘ARE HUMANS DEFINITELY CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING?’ FROM THE
GUARDIAN

Just as the world’s most respected scientific bodies have confirmed that
world is getting hotter, they have also stated that there is strong evidence
that humans are driving the warming. The 2005 joint statement from
the national academies of Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
India, Italy, Japan, Russia, the UK and the US said:
“It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be
attributed to human activities.”
Countless more recent statements and reports from the world’s
leading scientific bodies have said the same thing. For example, a 2010
summary of climate science by the Royal Society stated that:
“There is strong evidence that the warming of the Earth over the last
half-century has been caused largely by human activity, such as the
burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, including agriculture and
deforestation.”
The idea that humans could change the planet’s climate may be counterintuitive, but the basic science is well understood. Each year, human
activity causes billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases to be released
into the atmosphere. As scientists have known for decades, these gases
capture heat that would otherwise escape to space – the equivalent of
wrapping the planet in an invisible blanket.
Of course, the planet’s climate has always been in flux thanks to
“natural” factors such as changes in solar or volcanic activity, or cycles
relating the Earth’s orbit around the sun. According to the scientific
literature, however, the warming recorded to date matches the pattern
of warming we would expect from a build up of greenhouse gas in the
atmosphere – not the warming we would expect from other possible
causes.

Reviews play an important part in the relationship between an artistic product
and the public. A series of good reviews can help a book, video game,
television series or CD album to succeed. A professional review performs
several functions, such as:
◼◼ informing the reader about the product and its intended audience
◼◼ engaging the reader by the quality of the writing
◼◼ offering a series of critical judgements on aspects of the product
◼◼ making a recommendation as to whether the work is worth seeing, reading,

immersive Involving.

The action takes place some years after the events of Return of the Jedi,
and involves scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) teaming up with renegade ‘First
Order’ Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and globular droid BB-8. The
opening scroll sets up an ongoing battle between the forces of good and
evil and lays the groundwork for a quasi-mythical quest that will reunite
friends old and new, and allow a grizzled Harrison Ford to deliver the line:
‘Chewie, we’re home…’
That sense of coming home runs throughout The Force Awakens, director
JJ Abrams taking the series back to its roots while giving it a rocketfuelled, 21st-century twist. …The film feels very physical, scenes of
dog-fighting TIE fighters and a relaunched Millennium Falcon crashing
through trees possessing the kind of heft so sorely lacking from George
Lucas’s over-digitised prequels. The battle scenes are breathtakingly
immersive…but also impressively joyous – the sight of a fleet of X-wings
hurtling toward us over watery terrain brought a lump to my throat and a
tear to my eye – just one of several occasions when I found myself welling
up with unexpected emotion…
Having co-written the series’s previous high-water mark, The Empire
Strikes Back, Lawrence Kasdan here shares credits with Abrams and
Michael Arndt on a screenplay … which subtly realigns its gender
dynamics with Rey’s proudly punchy, post-Hunger Games heroine. The
spectre of Vader may live on in Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren, but it’s Rey
in whom the film’s true force resides, likeable newcomer Daisy Ridley
carrying the heavily-mantled weight of the new series with aplomb.
Plaudits, too, to John Boyega, who brings credibility and humour to the
almost accidentally heroic role of Finn…

What’s most striking about Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the fact that
it has real heart and soul… Abrams breathes new life into Lucas’s epochal
creations in a manner that deftly looks back to the future. And it’s a future
that works. Watching the film in a packed auditorium with an audience
almost incandescent with expectation, I found myself listening to a
chorus of spontaneous gasps, cheers, laughs, whoops and even occasional
cries of anguish.
What’s really surprising is that many of them were coming from me.

on a great variety of topics. Some reference books offer an overview of all
knowledge, such as the famous Encyclopaedia Britannica. Other reference
books have a much more specialised range – there are thousands of reference
books covering every academic discipline and field of knowledge.

the writing style differs from the other types of non-fiction writing that you have

▼ ‘ACQUISITION AND RECORDING OF INFORMATION IN
DIGITAL FORM’, FROM ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA
The versatility of modern information systems stems from their ability to
represent information electronically as digital signals and to manipulate it
automatically at exceedingly high speeds. Information is stored in binary
devices, which are the basic components of digital technology. Because these
devices exist only in one of two states, information is represented in them
either as the absence or the presence of energy (electric pulse). The two states
of binary devices are conveniently designated by the binary digits, or bits,
zero (0) and one (1).

Rap, a musical style in which rhythmic and/or rhyming speech is chanted

digital sampling (music and sounds extracted from other recordings), is also
called hip-hop, the name used to refer to a broader cultural movement that
includes rap, deejaying (turntable manipulation), graffiti painting, and break
dancing. Rap, which originated in African American communities in New
York City, came to national prominence with the Sugar Hill Gang’s ‘Rapper’s
Delight’ (1979). Rap’s early stars included Grandmaster Flash and the
Furious Five, Run-D.M.C., LL Cool J, Public Enemy (who espoused a radical
political message), and the Beastie Boys. The late 1980s saw the advent of
‘gangsta rap,’ with lyrics that were often misogynistic or that glamorized
violence and drug dealing. Later stars include Diddy, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z,
OutKast, Eminem, Kanye West, and Lil Wayne.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

IDENTIFYING THE WRITER’S PERSPECTIVE

This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ identify the writer’s
perspective
◼◼ understand how a writer
communicates their
perspective to a reader

A writer’s perspective is their point of view, or the angle from which
they see the subject matter. Even the most purely informative
articles, which show no personal angle at all, can be said to have a
point of view, even if that point of view is objective or unbiased.
Many articles or pieces of writing that claim to be objective are not always
unbiased, because everyone brings a personal, societal or national bias to bear
on what they write. An article written for an encyclopaedia in the United States
of America will be written from an American perspective, which means that the
article may be different to one written in China, even though it is apparently
unbiased. If the subject of the writing is politics, history or culture, national
perspectives will often be very different. For example, in the travel writing extract
on page 68, Stanley Stewart writes from the perspective of a curious British
traveller, not from that of a native Mongolian. This fact means that his account of
the wedding is entirely different from that of a native Mongolian.
There are many different types of perspective. The writer’s origin in a particular
community or ethnic group may give them a particular perspective. Having
a certain job or occupation might also influence their perspective – we could
say they write from the perspective of an economist, a student, a singer, and
so on. Martin Luther King’s famous speech, ‘I have a dream...’ is written from
the point of view of a black American minister who has become the voice of a
whole people.

DIFFERENCES IN PERSPECTIVE

In comparison, one of the commonest reasons for difference in perspective
is the fact that people interact with others whom they do not necessarily
understand. This may not be because of what they do or where they come
from, but simply because people cannot know exactly what is going on in
another person’s thoughts. This is shown by the following accounts of the
same event.

▼ GREG’S ACCOUNT
It was awful. He hit me hard in the face and all his friends laughed at me
when I started to cry. I was just walking past and was trying to be helpful by
pointing out that the bell had gone. They always laugh at me in the corridor
and I thought if I tried to help they would like me more. I don’t understand
what is going on.

▼ DARREN’S ACCOUNT
This has nothing to do with my friends. They didn’t even realise what had
happened until after I hit him. I think they were laughing at a joke Jack had
made. I did punch him, but that was because he told me I was going to be late
with this smirk on his face like he was going to tell the teacher. I have never
really seen him before and I thought he was trying to show me up in front of
my friends.

DIFFERENT ATTITUDES
KEY POINT

Attitude affects language. When you reread the extracts, think about how the
writer uses language to communicate
certain things to us and what this
reveals about the writer’s purpose and
personality.

Another way of thinking about perspectives is to think of the writer in relation
to two or more groups of people with different attitudes – one group which
shares their views and another group, or other groups, which do not share
these views. Ask yourself which groups would agree with a particular idea
or argument and which would disagree. For example, one group might be
more conservative (resistant to change), while another group might be more
progressive (looking for positive change). Another common opposition is
that between the authoritarian or restrictive and the liberal or tolerant. Often,
the older generation is seen as being authoritarian and young people are
considered to be more liberal.

some overlap between them and some people can be placed more in
between the groups?

at risk of offending in deprived areas. Arsenal FC delivers Kickz in
Elthorne Park, getting kids off the street in the evening and playing
football. The project has helped to transform the local area: there has
been a reduction of 66% in youth crime within a one-mile radius of the
project since it started.
… The projects are targeted at neighbourhoods with high levels of
antisocial behaviour and crime. … The sessions mostly involve football
coaching, but they also provide coaching in other sports, such as
basketball, and workshops on issues including drug awareness, healthy
eating, volunteering, careers and weapons.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

AUDIENCE AND PURPOSE

This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ identify the text’s audience
and understand the purpose.

HINT

Writers do not only write from a particular
perspective. They also write with a
particular ‘view’ in front of them, which
includes their purpose and audience,
meaning that these three aspects are
closely connected.

It is not always easy to appreciate a text unless you understand
its purpose and who it was written for. Sometimes this is not
difficult, such as when the reader is a member of the writer’s
intended audience. If you were a child born in Ghana or Jamaica,
then the stories of Anansi the spider would be intended for you
and there would be no additional context to learn about. However,
in other cases, you may need some background knowledge: for
example, Martin Luther King’s speech, ‘I have a dream...’, does
not mean all that it should if its reader is ignorant of the history
and culture of the USA. Likewise, the poem, The Bright Lights of
Sarajevo, means a great deal more to us if we know something
about the Bosnian War of the 1990s.

▶

When you are reading, you should try to bear in mind the audience known
as ‘the general reader’ or ‘the general public’. These phrases are used to
indicate that all kinds of people may want to read a book about an expedition
to the Himalayas or up the River Amazon, and that you do not need to have
any particular interests to find the book interesting. However, it would also
be reasonable to suggest that such books will appeal to readers interested in
adventurous travel. This group will cross boundaries of age, gender, race, and
so on, as it is defined by interest only, although it may include more of one
section of the population than another.

▶▶ Do a survey of people you know and find out, for example, if outdoor
adventure books such as Between a Rock and a Hard Place might appeal
more to male readers than female, or more to younger readers than older
ones. You could try this on other texts.

A writer’s purpose has a good deal to do with their audience: a writer will
never write for everyone. A writer’s choice of language is also affected by both.
Suppose that you were writing a story about a crime for a seven-year-old child.
You would choose appropriate language for the reader, considering their age
or level of understanding and the subject matter. Your choices would be very
different if you had to write a script for a stand-up comedian.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

LANGUAGE FOR DIFFERENT EFFECTS

This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand how writers use
their expertise with language
to create a range of varied
effects.

Many writers think about their potential readers when they are
writing. We have already looked at purpose and perspective,
and now we are going to build on this by considering more of
the effects that writers can achieve with their choice of words,
phrases and sentences. Some of the examples in this section will
be taken from the passages you have already looked at.

▶

GETTING CLOSE TO THE READER

Some writers want to create a close relationship with their readers, while others
do not. In autobiographies, writers may share very private thoughts and deal
with difficult emotions. They can use chatty or colloquial speech if they feel that
that is the best way to engage with their readers. Diaries can be good examples
of this, whether their authors are writing only for themselves or for others.

EMOTIVE LANGUAGE

In A Passage to Africa, George Alagiah wants to shock the reader and to
communicate the suffering that he sees in the villages that he visits. He wants
us to see in our mind’s eye the things he writes about.
Of the writers that you have read so far, which other writers have used emotive
language?

KEY POINT

Learning the technical terms for
descriptive effects will allow you to
express yourself more precisely in your
analysis of writing.

NON-FICTION TEXTS

87

Many students find it difficult to think of ways to describe the effects of
language and tend to overuse words like ‘descriptive’ when it is not strictly
accurate, or rely on vague phrases such as ‘draws the reader in’. Try using
some of the following alternatives.
Alliteration and assonance

Makes language more emphatic/more rhythmic/more
memorable.

Onomatopoeia

Makes phrases more vivid and powerful.

Descriptive phrasing

Makes the reader imagine the scene.

Verbs of motion and action

Make the language more dynamic and energetic.

Wordplay, exaggeration

Makes writing light-hearted, amusing.

Abstract nouns

Make writing more intellectual or more to do with
ideas.

Repetition

Emphasises a particular point or word.

A mixture of techniques

Makes language varied; lively, etc.

Other techniques include:
◼◼ anaphora
◼◼ balanced phrases
◼◼ allusions
◼◼ juxtaposition.
Look these up in a dictionary and see if you can find examples in the texts in
this book.

USING SENTENCE TYPES FOR
EFFECT

There are two obvious ways of classifying sentence types by their function and
by their grammatical complexity.

SENTENCE FUNCTION
Statements

Dominate informative writing and narrative in stories.

Questions

Common in dialogue and in explorative articles. They can be used
in speeches to engage the audience, particularly in the form of
rhetorical questions.

Exclamations

Mainly found in dialogue, but also in first person accounts of
adventures, real life experiences and so on.

HINT

Commands

Help yourself to learn these by thinking of
and writing an example of each one.

Usually found in dialogue and instructions. They use the imperative
form of the verb (for example, ‘Come on, let’s move).’

Wishes

Expressions of thoughts and feelings often found in diaries, letters
and dialogue (for example, ‘If only I hadn’t done that.’).

SENTENCE COMPLEXITY
Simple sentences

Consist of only one main clause.

Compound sentences

Two or more main clauses joined by ‘and’, ‘but’, ‘so’ or ‘or’.

Complex sentences

Contain at least one subordinate clause.

Incomplete sentences

Do not have a complete main clause or used frequently in
conversation and in writing for effect or emphasis or in oneword sentences such as, ‘He stopped. Silence.’).

FACTS AND OPINION

▲ The best sport in the world?

As we have already seen, non-fiction texts often include people’s opinions and
beliefs, even if they may not be factually true. This includes:
◼◼ opinions as statements of belief, such as, ‘I think football is the best sport
in the world’
◼◼ opinions stated as fact.
Be careful when someone states an opinion or belief as though it is a fact.
For example, the second statement about football has the form of a factual
statement, but it is still really just a statement of belief about football. People
often make statements of belief as though they are facts, so you should always
ask questions of what you read and analyse what people write as facts when
they may in fact be statements of belief.
For example, advertisers may state opinion as fact. Washing products may be
advertised as making clothes whiter than other brands of washing detergent,
but it is unlikely that these statements can be said to be ‘facts’.
In comparison, an argument is an opinion or set of opinions backed up by
reasons and evidence. It would be easy to express an opinion that you are the
President of the United States, but hard to construct an argument that proves
that you are the President of the United States.

KEY POINT

You need to know how to recognise

form is justified.

Read the following extracts, then decide whether they are fact, opinion,
argument, or opinion presented as fact.
‘It’s a fact that boys are stronger than girls.’
‘Everyone knows that Britain would be better off outside the
European Union. I don’t know anyone who thinks otherwise.’
‘We should encourage immigration into this country for three
reasons: it supplies us with more skills, it helps us to understand
other cultures and it is morally a good thing to do.’
‘The USA is more powerful in military terms than Russia.’
‘I think that all religions are equally valid: I don’t know about all of
them, but they all have their good points and their less good points.’

effect does this have?

get some support advice often suggests
how to get more support and advice.

avoid the shops Advice is often both
positive and negative (‘dos and don’ts’); for
example, ‘avoid the shops’ is a ‘don’t’.

Non-fiction texts can contain examples of advice. For example, a book review
may advise you to read or not to read a particular book. An online article
may advise you how to save money, how to prepare for a hot summer, or
recommend places to visit. An ‘agony aunt’ in a magazine could suggest ways
of coping with problems in a personal relationship.
Generally speaking, we appreciate advice more if it comes from someone who
knows what they are talking about: an expert. Advice is linked to persuasive
writing, since it tries to influence the person being advised.
Dear Billy,
Your letter shows you really want to give up smoking and that is the first
step to making it happen. You won’t be alone; all the coolest people are
giving it up now.
Make no mistake, it is difficult to stop – but you can do it. Lots of people
have managed to kick the habit.
Here’s how you start.
Make a plan.
1. Set a date for your last cigarette and stick to it!
2. Try and get some support from a friend or relative. It always helps to talk
to someone about problems – a problem shared is a problem halved!
3. Keep busy to help take your mind off ciggies. Perhaps take up a new
hobby or sport, like cycling.
4. Try to change your routine, and avoid the shops where you usually buy
cigarettes.
5. Save up the money that you normally spend on cigarettes and buy
something special for yourself with it.
Good luck – I hope it all goes well. Quitting smoking will make you feel a lot
better and, with the exercise from your cycling, you should be able to wave
stress goodbye!
All the best,

SKILLS

What do you understand is meant by the word, ‘structure’? Try
writing down a short definition of ‘structure’ in relation to a
piece of writing. You could use one of the extracts in this book or
another text that you know.

▶

Most of us respond to a skilfully structured piece of writing without understanding
exactly why. When analysing structure, then, we have to understand the purpose
of a passage, which can only be done by careful reading. The next task is see the
structure within it that helps put the purpose into effect. We can then write about:
◼◼ the writer’s intention in the text
◼◼ the structure that the writer has used to achieve that intention
◼◼ the effects of each part of the structure.
Many students find it difficult to analyse structure in writing, but the following
techniques should help you.
◼◼ Think in terms of the beginning, middle and end of the text or extract. How
are they different from each other.
◼◼ Look at the paragraphs and identify the content of each one. Then
consider what the writer is doing with that content and why he or she
chose to put the content in that order.
◼◼ Look at the way in which the writer uses the basic types of writing you find
in non-fiction:
>> description (of the setting or the appearance of people and objects)
>> narrative (what happened or is happening)
>> dialogue or speech (including talking to one self)
>> thoughts and feelings (when not in direct speech)
>> background information, facts, or explanation.

I was set down from the carrier’s cart at the age of three; and there with a sense of bewilderment and terror my life
in the village began.
The June grass, amongst which I stood, was taller than I was, and I wept. I had never been so close to grass before. It
towered above me and all around me, each blade tattooed with tiger-skins of sunlight. It was knife-edged, dark, and
a wicked green, thick as a forest and alive with grasshoppers that chirped and chattered and leapt through the air
like monkeys.
I was lost and didn’t know where to move. A tropic heat oozed up from the ground, rank with sharp odours of roots
and nettles. Snow-clouds of elder-blossom banked in the sky, showering upon me the fumes and flakes of their sweet
and giddy suffocation. High overhead ran frenzied larks, screaming, as though the sky were tearing apart.

HINT

Try to bring together analytical and
writing skills – think about how and why
you would structure a piece of your own
writing.
KEY POINT

When people talk about the structure of
a piece, they are not normally referring
to sentence structure, which is usually
regarded as a linguistic feature.
However, there are two points worth
bearing in mind.
1. You might notice that a piece
ends or begins with a very short
sentence, in which case the writer
is using sentence structure as
a deliberate part of the larger
structure.
2. Sentence structure is still an
important point to consider. If
you can make a good point about
sentence structure, then you should
include it in your answer.

It can also be useful to consider the types of writing that the writer is using,
such as description, narrative and so on. For example, a passage with some
description of the setting, or a character, followed by some narrative in which
something happens. As soon as you notice these different types of writing,
you should be able to say something about why they are there in the passage.
Many students do not consciously register when a writer is using dialogue or
telling us a character’s thoughts, so if you do notice these things, you will give
yourself an immediate advantage.
Copy and complete the following table, using the analysis you have just made,
to list four examples of different types of writing used by Lee in the passage
that you have just read.

PAPER 1

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ Understand how to tackle
questions 1–3 on an unseen
text.

READING UNSEEN TEXTS

NON-FICTION TEXTS

UNSEEN TEXTS
The questions in Paper 1 Section A will be based on two
passages: one from the Non-fiction texts Anthology, with which
you will be familiar, and another passage that you will not have
seen before. Understanding and analysing this unseen text is
critical to your success in this part of the exam.

▶

The first thing to do when faced with an unseen text is to read it and start
thinking about what it is saying. Try not to be scared by the fact that you have
never seen it before. By using the skills that you have learned by studying
other texts, you should have all the tools you need to understand it and
analyse it effectively.
When you have read the text, use these questions to help you think about what
you have read:
◼◼ What sort of text is it?
◼◼ What is the text about?
◼◼ Who is the intended audience for the text?
◼◼ Is the writer trying to make a particular point?
◼◼ What literary techniques does the writer use?
◼◼ What effects do these techniques have?
◼◼ How does the text make you feel personally?
Simply by answering these questions, you will find that you are able to say
a lot about the unseen text. You should spend a short time reading the text
and getting a good understanding of it. This will then allow you to focus on
answering the specifics in the exam questions.
For this section, we will use the passage from Cider with Rosie on pages
90–91 as the unseen text.

At the end of the street, sheltering from the rain under a tatty

grill. I took a seat on the cold steps of the grocery store from which
she served, and watched her work while a steady stream of customers
pulled in from the rain.
I ordered a bowl of grilled chicken gizzards, served on a heap of
sweet corn and fried kernels of salted maize and it was immediately
clear that she knew what she was doing. As the evening passed by the
buses, trucks and pick-ups splashed through the rain filled potholes
of the main street. We didn’t talk much, but that seemed normal here
in Ecuador, but from what little was said, and my persistent interest
in the secret of her giblets, it was obvious we enjoyed a common love
of food, and it wasn’t long before our conversation turned to Cuy. I
expressed my dismay at having only found this traditional dish strung
up like freshly run over roadkill in front of the tourist restaurants
en route from Otavalo to Quito, and my keenness to see how these
rodents were prepared at home. I was invited for lunch the next day.

Cuy, conejillo de Indias – Indian rabbits, or guinea pigs as we know

and Ecuador since pre-Inca times. Fifteen centuries later, they still
remain an Andean delicacy, and on average Peruvians and Ecuadorians
gobble down twenty-two million of these tasty rodents every year.
Most Andean households keep cuy at home in the same way that we
might keep chickens. Considered a speciality, they are mostly saved
for special occasions. Rather like a bottle of champagne or perhaps
a box of Ferrero Rocher, a mating pair of guinea pigs are a typical
house warming gift for a newlywed couple. Playing an integral role in
Andean religious and ceremonial practices, as well as providing dinner,
cuy are also used in the traditional medicine of the region. A live cuy is
rubbed over the body of someone sick. The cuy’s squeaking indicates
the diseased area of the human patient.

‘THE DANGER OF A SINGLE STORY’
CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE

GENERAL VOCABULARY

registrar keeping official records of the

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie was born the fifth of six children in
the town of Nsukka in south-eastern Nigeria, where the University
of Nigeria is situated. Her father was a professor of statistics at
the university and her mother was the university’s first female
registrar.
Adichie studied medicine and pharmacy at the University of
Nigeria for a year and a half. Then she left Nigeria to study
communications and political science in the USA. Now she
divides her time between Nigeria, where she teaches writing
workshops, and the United States.
She has published poetry and fiction and her novels have
won several awards. For example, her first novel, Purple
Hibiscus (2003), was awarded the Commonwealth Writers’
Prize for Best First Book (2005). Adichie says of feminism and
writing, ‘I think of myself as a storyteller, but I would not mind at
all if someone were to think of me as a feminist writer... I’m very
feminist in the way I look at the world, and that world view must
somehow be part of my work.’

CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE
Adichie, a successful novelist, delivered this speech at a TED

danger of a single view.
I’m a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories
about what I like to call ‘the danger of the single story.’ I grew up on
a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started
reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to
the truth. So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and
American children’s books.

PAPER 1

TEXT ANTHOLOGY: NON-FICTION

I was also an early writer, and when I began to write, at about the
age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor
mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I
was reading: all my characters were white and blue-eyed, they played
in the snow, they ate apples, and they talked a lot about the weather,
how lovely it was that the sun had come out.

97

15

Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been
outside Nigeria. We didn’t have snow, we ate mangoes, and we never
talked about the weather, because there was no need to. …

impressionable Easily influenced.
Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye
Prominent and pioneering Nigerian authors
in the second half of the 20th century.

What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable
we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I
had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become
convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in
them and had to be about things with which I could not personally
identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There
weren’t many of them available, and they weren’t quite as easy to find
as the foreign books.
But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye, I went
through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that
people like me, girls with skin the colour of chocolate, whose kinky
hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to
write about things I recognised.
Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my
imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended
consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist
in literature. So what the discovery of African writers did for me was
this: it saved me from having a single story of what books are.
I come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family. My father
was a professor. My mother was an administrator. And so we had,
as was the norm, live-in domestic help, who would often come from
nearby rural villages. So, the year I turned eight, we got a new house
boy. His name was Fide. The only thing my mother told us about him
was that his family was very poor. My mother sent yams and rice, and
our old clothes, to his family. And when I didn’t finish my dinner, my
mother would say, ‘Finish your food! Don’t you know? People like
Fide’s family have nothing.’ So I felt enormous pity for Fide’s family.

Ngozi Adichie

raffia Dry palm leaves.
Mariah Carey Popular American singer.

Then one Saturday, we went to his village to visit, and his mother
showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that
his brother had made. I was startled. It had not occurred to me that
anybody in his family could actually make something. All I had heard
about them was how poor they were, so that it had become impossible
for me to see them as anything else but poor. Their poverty was my
single story of them.
Years later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university
in the United States. I was 19. My American roommate was shocked
by me. She asked where I had learned to speak English so well, and
was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as
its official language. She asked if she could listen to what she called
my ‘tribal music’, and was consequently very disappointed when I
produced my tape of Mariah Carey.

PAPER 1

TEXT ANTHOLOGY: NON-FICTION

She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove.

stove What do you notice about this
paragraph?

AIDS Auto-immune Deficiency Syndrome,
threat to life in some African countries.

What struck me was this: she had felt sorry for me even before she
saw me. Her default position toward me, as an African, was a kind
of patronising, well-meaning pity. My roommate had a single story of
Africa: a single story of catastrophe. In this single story, there was no
possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way, no possibility
of feelings more complex than pity, no possibility of a connection as
human equals. …
So, after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African, I began to
understand my roommate’s response to me. If I had not grown up in
Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images,
I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes,
beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless
wars, dying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and
waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner. I would see Africans in
the same way that I, as a child, had seen Fide’s family. …
But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question
of the single story. A few years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S.
The political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense, and there
were debates going on about immigration. And, as often happens in
America, immigration became synonymous with Mexicans. There were
endless stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare
system, sneaking across the border, being arrested at the border, that
sort of thing.

fleecing Exploiting someone financially;

I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara, watching
the people going to work, rolling up tortillas in the marketplace,
smoking, laughing. I remember first feeling slight surprise. And then, I
was overwhelmed with shame. I realised that I had been so immersed
in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in
my mind, the abject immigrant. I had bought into the single story of
Mexicans and I could not have been more ashamed of myself.

So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as
only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become. …
Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to
dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and
to humanise. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can
also repair that broken dignity.
The American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern
relatives who had moved to the North. She introduced them to a book
about the Southern life that they had left behind. ‘They sat around,
reading the book themselves, listening to me read the book, and a kind
of paradise was regained.’
I would like to end with this thought: That when we reject the single
story, when we realise that there is never a single story about any
place, we regain a kind of paradise.

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT

This is a speech delivered to a conference with an educational theme. In it,
Adichie discusses the power and influence that simple storytelling can have,
particularly on the young. She shows from her own experience how stories can
cause prejudices and that new stories are then needed to redress the balance.
Her argument is even more compelling because she shows how she herself
was vulnerable to just such influences.
She explains how all the stories she knew when she was growing up were
European in outlook, perspective and characterisation, which led her to think
that all stories had to be about white people. Then she shows that some
Americans tend to have a very limited and simplified impression of Africa,
not realising, for example, that there is such a thing as an educated Nigerian
middle class. In the last part she explains how she herself had an equally
limited view of Mexican culture, influenced by American worries about illegal
immigration and drugs.
In this speech, Adichie uses personal stories, or anecdotes, to persuade
us that we need to hear or read a wide variety of stories to understand the
peoples of the world. To rely on what she calls the ‘single story’ will never be
enough.

The language of this passage is anecdotal and persuasive: it is evident that
the writer is trying hard to communicate some linked experiences that were
important to her in making her examine the way that people form prejudiced
views of others. She tries to do this as concisely as possible. She uses
narrative, detail, emotive language and makes comments about her thoughts
and feelings.
The sentence structure is varied in the speech: compare the sentence
beginning, ‘If I had not grown up in Nigeria…’ (lines 69 to 75), with the short
simple sentence with which the passage begins. What do you think such
variety contributes to a piece such as this? Speech-writing also offers the

All good persuasive speeches have a clear structure, enabling the audience
to follow the points linked together in an argument. The structure of this
speech is simple and effective. You can soon see that it is written in eighteen
paragraphs. One way of analysing the structure would be to summarise the
content of each paragraph in a sentence. Another way would be to divide the
speech into sections and chart it that way.

EXTRACTS FROM SAMPLE RESPONSES TO QUESTION 2
In a school assembly the headteacher talked about an appalling civil war that
had happened in part of Africa, and in which hundreds of thousands of people
had been massacred, just because they were an ethnic minority. I had got used
to people saying that we ought to respect the beliefs of others and I thought that
pretty much all countries accepted this by now. I mean, I knew something about
the holocaust in Europe during the Second World War – it was so terrible that it
was a warning to the rest of the world never to do anything like that ever again.
But this was another attempt at genocide, in my own lifetime. I realised that I
had been wrong. It was going to take much longer for the whole world to learn. If

reader, is it well structured, the accuracy of the spelling and grammar, and
generally how well the text has achieved the task set by the question.

I supposed I’d always envied him in a way, I mean he was good at sports, I mean
I’m alright but he was obviusly excellent, and he was quite clever as well. I sort
of resented the way he could do things quite easily. So I never really gave him
much of a chance. I slagged him off to my friends saying he was arrogant and
such (using some nice slangy phrases of course).
Later though he did me a good turn, though I didn’t deserve it. He spoke up for
me when I was trying hard to get into the first XI, and said I deserved a chance. I
honestly dont know why he did, but it made a diffrence.
It happened like this……

▼ FROM A PASSAGE TO AFRICA BY GEORGE ALAGIAH
I saw a thousand hungry, lean, scared and betrayed faces as I crisscrossed Somalia between the end of 1991 and December 1992, but
there is one I will never forget.
I was in a little hamlet just outside Gufgaduud, a village in the back of
beyond, a place the aid agencies had yet to reach. In my notebook I had
jotted down instructions on how to get there. ‘Take the Badale Road for
a few kilometres til the end of the tarmac, turn right on to a dirt track,
stay on it for about forty-five minutes – Gufgaduud. Go another fifteen
minutes approx. – like a ghost village.’

5

10
In the ghoulish manner of journalists on the hunt for the most striking
pictures, my cameraman and I tramped from one hut to another. What
might have appalled us when we’d started our trip just a few days before
no longer impressed us much. The search for the shocking is like the
craving for a drug: you require heavier and more frequent doses the
15
longer you’re at it. Pictures that stun the editors one day are written off
as the same old stuff the next. This sounds callous, but it is just a fact of
life. It’s how we collect and compile the images that so move people in
the comfort of their sitting rooms back home.
▲ The civil war in Somalia began in 1991

There was Amina Abdirahman, who had gone out that morning in search
20
of wild, edible roots, leaving her two young girls lying on the dirt floor
of their hut. They had been sick for days, and were reaching the final,
enervating stages of terminal hunger. Habiba was ten years old and her
sister, Ayaan, was nine. By the time Amina returned, she had only one
daughter. Habiba had died. No rage, no whimpering, just a passing away –
25
that simple, frictionless, motionless deliverance from a state of half-life to
death itself. It was, as I said at the time in my dispatch, a vision of ‘famine
away from the headlines, a famine of quiet suffering and lonely death’.
There was the old woman who lay in her hut, abandoned by relations
who were too weak to carry her on their journey to find food. It was the
smell that drew me to her doorway: the smell of decaying flesh. Where
her shinbone should have been there was a festering wound the size of
my hand. She’d been shot in the leg as the retreating army of the deposed
dictator took revenge on whoever it found in its way. The shattered leg
had fused into the gentle V-shape of a boomerang. It was rotting; she was
rotting. You could see it in her sick, yellow eyes and smell it in the putrid
air she recycled with every struggling breath she took.

And then there was the face I will never forget.
revulsion Disgust.
surreptitiously Secretly.

My reaction to everyone else I met that day was a mixture of pity and
revulsion. Yes, revulsion. The degeneration of the human body, sucked of
its natural vitality by the twin evils of hunger and disease, is a disgusting 40
thing. We never say so in our TV reports. It’s a taboo that has yet to be
breached. To be in a feeding centre is to hear and smell the excretion of
fluids by people who are beyond controlling their bodily functions. To
be in a feeding centre is surreptitiously to wipe your hands on the back
of your trousers after you’ve held the clammy palm of a mother who has 45
just cleaned vomit from her child’s mouth.
There’s pity, too, because even in this state of utter despair they aspire
to a dignity that is almost impossible to achieve. An old woman will
cover her shrivelled body with a soiled cloth as your gaze turns towards

I saw that face for only a few seconds, a fleeting meeting of eyes before the
face turned away, as its owner retreated into the darkness of another hut.
In those brief moments there had been a smile, not from me, but from the 55
face. It was not a smile of greeting, it was not a smile of joy – how could
it be? – but it was a smile nonetheless. It touched me in a way I could not
explain. It moved me in a way that went beyond pity or revulsion.
What was it about that smile? I had to find out. I urged my translator to
ask the man why he had smiled. He came back with an answer. ‘It’s just
that he was embarrassed to be found in this condition,’ the translator
explained. And then it clicked. That’s what the smile had been about. It
was the feeble smile that goes with apology, the kind of smile you might
give if you felt you had done something wrong.
inured Hardened,

Normally inured to stories of suffering, accustomed to the evidence
of deprivation, I was unsettled by this one smile in a way I had never
been before. There is an unwritten code between the journalist and
his subjects in these situations. The journalist observes, the subject
is observed. The journalist is active, the subject is passive. But this
smile had turned the tables on that tacit agreement. Without uttering
a single word, the man had posed a question that cut to the heart of
the relationship between me and him, between us and them, between
the rich world and the poor world. If he was embarrassed to be found
weakened by hunger and ground down by conflict, how should I feel to
be standing there so strong and confident?

60

75

I resolved there and then that I would write the story of Gufgaduud with
all the power and purpose I could muster. It seemed at the time, and still
does, the only adequate answer a reporter can give to the man’s question.
I have one regret about that brief encounter in Gufgaduud. Having
searched through my notes and studied the dispatch that the BBC
80
broadcast, I see that I never found out what the man’s name was.
Yet meeting him was a seminal moment in the gradual collection of
experiences we call context. Facts and figures are the easy part of
journalism. Knowing where they sit in the great scheme of things is
much harder. So, my nameless friend, if you are still alive, I owe you one. 85

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Kari Herbert’s father was a polar explorer. She lived as a child
with her family in northwest Greenland in the Arctic. She was so
fascinated by the place that she returned there later as an adult
to write about it.
The book from which this extract is taken is partly a memoir
and partly a travel book, giving the reader information about
this strange and beautiful place, its people and its animals. She
found that the way of life of the Inughuit people of Greenland
was changing due to the impact of the modern world. However
they still retained aspects of their traditional way of life, such as
hunting for food and driving teams of dogs.
A major part of the extract is an account of a hunt for narwhal.
Hunting is a very emotive issue and many conservationists argue
that whales should be protected. Kari Herbert’s feelings on this
topic are divided. She sympathises with both the narwhal and the
hunters, who face incredible danger. They hunt in kayaks in water
so cold that they would die quickly if their kayak overturned.

Two hours after the last of the hunters had returned and eaten, narwhal were
spotted again, this time very close. Within an hour even those of us on shore
could with the naked eye see the plumes of spray from the narwhal catching
the light in a spectral play of colour. Two large pods of narwhal circled in
the fjord, often looking as if they were going to merge, but always slowly,
methodically passing each other by. Scrambling back up to the lookout
I looked across the glittering kingdom in front of me and took a sharp
intake of breath. The hunters were dotted all around the fjord. The evening
light was turning butter-gold, glinting off man and whale and catching the
soft billows of smoke from a lone hunter’s pipe. From where we sat at the
lookout it looked as though the hunters were close enough to touch the
narwhal with their bare hands and yet they never moved. Distances are
always deceptive in the Arctic, and I fell to wondering if the narwhal existed
at all or were instead mischievous tricks of the shifting light.
The narwhal rarely stray from High Arctic waters, escaping only to the
slightly more temperate waters towards the Arctic Circle in the dead of
winter, but never entering the warmer southern seas. In summer the hunters
of Thule are fortunate to witness the annual return of the narwhal to the
Inglefield Fjord, on the side of which we now sat.
The narwhal is an essential contributor to the survival of the hunters in
the High Arctic. The mattak or blubber of the whale is rich in necessary
minerals and vitamins, and in a place where the climate prohibits the growth
of vegetables or fruit, this rich source of vitamin C was the one reason that
the Eskimos have never suffered from scurvy. For centuries the blubber of
the whales was also the only source of light and heat, and the dark rich meat
is still a valuable part of the diet for both man and dogs (a single narwhal
can feed a team of dogs for an entire month). Its single ivory tusk, which
can grow up to six feet in length, was used for harpoon tips and handles for
other hunting implements (although the ivory was found to be brittle and not
hugely satisfactory as a weapon), for carving protective tupilaks, and even
as a central beam for their small ancient dwellings. Strangely, the tusk seems
to have little use for the narwhal itself; they do not use the tusk to break
through ice as a breathing hole, nor will they use it to catch or attack prey,
but rather the primary use seems to be to disturb the top of the sea bed in
order to catch Arctic halibut for which they have a particular predilection.
Often the ends of their tusks are worn down or even broken from such usage.
The women clustered on the knoll of the lookout, binoculars pointing in
every direction, each woman focusing on her husband or family member,
occasionally spinning round at a small gasp or jump as one of the women
saw a hunter near a narwhal. Each wife knew her husband instinctively and
watched their progress intently; it was crucial to her that her husband catch

TEXT ANTHOLOGY: NON-FICTION

a narwhal – it was part of their staple diet, and some of the mattak and
meat could be sold to other hunters who hadn’t been so lucky, bringing in
some much-needed extra income. Every hunter was on the water. It was like
watching a vast, waterborne game with the hunters spread like a net around
the sound.
The narwhal are intelligent creatures, their senses are keen and they talk to
one another under the water. Their hearing is particularly developed and they
can hear the sound of a paddling kayak from a great distance. That was why
the hunters had to sit so very still in the water.
One hunter was almost on top of a pair of narwhal, and they were huge.
He gently picked up his harpoon and aimed – in that split second my heart
leapt for both hunter and narwhal. I urged the man on in my head; he was
so close, and so brave to attempt what he was about to do – he was miles
from land in a flimsy kayak, and could easily be capsized and drowned. The
hunter had no rifle, only one harpoon with two heads and one bladder. It was
a foolhardy exercise and one that could only inspire respect. And yet at the
same time my heart also urged the narwhal to dive, to leave, to survive.
This dilemma stayed with me the whole time that I was in Greenland. I
understand the harshness of life in the Arctic and the needs of the hunters
and their families to hunt and live on animals and sea mammals that we
demand to be protected because of their beauty. And I know that one cannot
afford to be sentimental in the Arctic. ‘How can you possibly eat seal?’ I have
been asked over and over again. True, the images that bombarded us several
years ago of men battering seals for their fur hasn’t helped the issue of polar
hunting, but the Inughuit do not kill seals using this method, nor do they kill
for sport. They use every part of the animals they kill, and most of the food
in Thule is still brought in by the hunter-gatherers and fishermen. Imported
goods can only ever account for part of the food supply; there is still only
one annual supply ship that makes it through the ice to Qaanaaq, and the
small twice-weekly plane from West Greenland can only carry a certain
amount of goods. Hunting is still an absolute necessity in Thule.

▼ ‘ EXPLORERS, OR BOYS MESSING ABOUT? EITHER WAY,
TAXPAYER GETS RESCUE BILL’ BY STEVEN MORRIS
Adapted from an article published in The Guardian newspaper,
January 28, 2003.
Their last expedition ended in farce when the Russians threatened to send
in military planes to intercept them as they tried to cross into Siberia via the
icebound Bering Strait.
Yesterday a new adventure undertaken by British explorers Steve Brooks and
Quentin Smith almost led to tragedy when their helicopter plunged into the
sea off Antarctica.
The men were plucked from the icy water by a Chilean naval ship after a
nine-hour rescue which began when Mr Brooks contacted his wife, Jo Vestey,
on his satellite phone asking for assistance. The rescue involved the Royal
Navy, the RAF and British coastguards.
Last night there was resentment in some quarters that the men’s adventure
had cost the taxpayers of Britain and Chile tens of thousands of pounds.
Experts questioned the wisdom of taking a small helicopter – the four-seater
Robinson R44 has a single engine – into such a hostile environment.
There was also confusion about what exactly the men were trying to achieve.
A website set up to promote the Bering Strait expedition claims the team
were planning to fly from the north to south pole in their ‘trusty helicopter’.
But Ms Vestey claimed she did not know what the pair were up to, describing
them as ‘boys messing about with a helicopter’.
The drama began at around 1 am British time when Mr Brooks, 42, and
40-year-old Mr Smith, also known as Q, ditched into the sea 100 miles off
Antarctica, about 36 miles north of Smith Island, and scrambled into their
liferaft.
Mr Brooks called his wife in London on his satellite phone. She said: ‘He said
they were both in the liferaft but were okay and could I call the emergency
people?’
Meanwhile, distress signals were being beamed from the ditched helicopter
and from Mr Brooks’ Breitling emergency watch, a wedding present.
Falmouth Coastal town in Cornwall,
England.

The signals from the aircraft were deciphered by Falmouth coastguard and
passed on to the rescue coordination centre at RAF Kinloss in Scotland.
The Royal Navy’s ice patrol ship, HMS Endurance, which was 180 miles
away surveying uncharted waters, began steaming towards the scene and
dispatched its two Lynx helicopters.
One was driven back because of poor visibility but the second was on its way
when the men were picked up by a Chilean naval vessel at about 10.20 am
British time.
Though the pair wore survival suits and the weather at the spot where
they ditched was clear, one Antarctic explorer told Mr Brooks’ wife it was
‘nothing short of a miracle’ that they had survived.

TEXT ANTHOLOGY: NON-FICTION

Both men are experienced adventurers. Mr Brooks, a property developer
from London, has taken part in expeditions to 70 countries in 15 years. He
has trekked solo to Everest base camp and walked barefoot for three days
in the Himalayas. He has negotiated the white water rapids of the Zambezi
river by kayak and survived a charge by a silver back gorilla in the Congo.
He is also a qualified mechanical engineer and pilot.
He and his wife spent their honeymoon flying the helicopter from Alaska to
Chile. The 16,000-mile trip took three months.
Mr Smith, also from London, claims to have been flying since the age of
five. He has twice flown a helicopter around the globe and won the world
freestyle helicopter flying championship. Despite their experience, it is not the
first time they have hit the headlines for the wrong reasons.
In April, Mr Brooks and another explorer, Graham Stratford, were poised
to become the first to complete a crossing of the 56-mile wide frozen Bering
Strait between the US and Russia in an amphibious vehicle, Snowbird VI,
which could carve its way through ice floes and float in the water in between.
But they were forced to call a halt after the Russian authorities told them
they would scramble military helicopters to lift them off the ice if they
crossed the border.
Ironically, one of the aims of the expedition, for which Mr Smith provided air
back-up, was to demonstrate how good relations between east and west had
become.
The wisdom of the team’s latest adventure was questioned by, among others,
Günter Endres, editor of Jane’s Helicopter Markets and Systems, who said:
‘I’m surprised they used the R44. I wouldn’t use a helicopter like that to go
so far over the sea. It sounds as if they were pushing it to the maximum.’
A spokesman for the pair said it was not known what had gone wrong. The
flying conditions had been ‘excellent’.
The Ministry of Defence said the taxpayer would pick up the bill, as was
normal in rescues in the UK and abroad. The spokesperson said it was ‘highly
unlikely’ it would recover any of the money.
Last night the men were on their way to the Chilean naval base Eduardo
Frei, where HMS Endurance was to pick them up. Ms Vestey said: ‘They
have been checked and appear to be well. I don’t know what will happen to
them once they have been picked up by HMS Endurance – they’ll probably
have their bottoms kicked and be sent home the long way.’

CRITICAL THINKING

On the surface, this may appear to be an information text, as the article
explains what happened to the two men and how they were rescued. However,
the writer also takes a strongly critical stance on what he sees as irresponsible
behaviour on the part of the two explorers. The key to understanding the
article is in recognising how the writer makes his opinions clear.

BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
ARON RALSTON
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Between a Rock and a Hard Place is an autobiography written by
Aron Ralston, an engineer turned outdoorsman and motivational
speaker. It relates his experience of being trapped for five days
and seven hours in Blue John Canyon of the Utah desert in the
southern United States, in 2003.
His right arm was trapped by a boulder and, unable to free
himself, he amputated his arm using a blunt pocketknife. He then
had to return through the canyon and climb down a 20-metre
slope before he could reach safety and receive medical care.

BEFORE YOU START READING
1 Read about Aron Ralston and his experience. If you are able to, watch
127 Hours, the 2010 film on the same subject.
2 Think about what attracts people to potentially dangerous outdoor
activities and sports. Is it a love of adventure? A sense of boredom? Or
something else entirely?
3 Share any accounts of survival or lucky escapes that you have heard or
read about.

▼ F ROM BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE BY ARON
RALSTON
In this first-hand account, Ralston describes how a boulder crushed
his right hand while he was climbing and hiking in a canyon. He had
not informed anyone of his hiking plans.
drop-off A sheer downward slope.
chockstone A stone that has become
stuck between rocks.

I come to another drop-off. This one is maybe eleven or twelve feet high,
a foot higher and of a different geometry than the overhang I descended
ten minutes ago. Another chockstone is wedged between the walls, ten feet
downstream from and at the same height as the ledge. It gives the space
below the drop-off the claustrophobic feel of a short tunnel. Instead of the
walls widening after the drop-off, or opening into a bowl at the bottom of
the canyon, here the slot narrows to a consistent three feet across at the lip of
the drop-off and continues at that width for fifty feet down the canyon.
Sometimes in narrow passages like this one, it’s possible for me to stem
my body across the slot, with my feet and back pushing out in opposite
directions against the walls. Controlling this counter pressure by switching
my hands and feet on the opposing walls, I can move up or down the
shoulder width crevice fairly easily as long as the friction contact stays solid
between the walls and my hands, feet, and back. This technique is known as
stemming or chimneying; you can imagine using it to climb up the inside of a
chimney.

A part of something (in this case,
the rock) that extends over something else.

torque Rotating force.
ricochet Bounces off.

Just below the ledge where I’m standing is a chockstone the size of a large
bus tire, stuck fast in the channel between the walls, a few feet out from the
lip. If I can step onto it, then I’ll have a nine foot height to descend, less than
that of the first overhang. I’ll dangle off the chockstone, then take a short fall
onto the rounded rocks piled on the canyon floor.
Stemming across the canyon at the lip of the drop-off, with one foot and one
hand on each of the walls, I traverse out to the chockstone. I press my back
against the south wall and lock my left knee, which pushes my foot tight
against the north wall. With my right foot, I kick at the boulder to test how
stuck it is. It’s jammed tightly enough to hold my weight. I lower myself from
the chimneying position and step onto the chockstone. It supports me but
teeters slightly. After confirming that I don’t want to chimney down from the
chockstone’s height, I squat and grip the rear of the lodged boulder, turning
to face back upcanyon. Sliding my belly over the front edge, I can lower
myself and hang from my fully extended arms, akin to climbing down from
the roof of a house.
As I dangle, I feel the stone respond to my adjusting grip with a scraping
quake as my body’s weight applies enough torque to disturb it from its
position. Instantly, I know this is trouble, and instinctively, I let go of the
rotating boulder to land on the round rocks below. When I look up, the
backlit chockstone falling toward my head consumes the sky. Fear shoots my
hands over my head. I can’t move backward or I’ll fall over a small ledge. My
only hope is to push off the falling rock and get my head out of its way.
The next three seconds play out at a tenth of their normal speed. Time
dilates, as if I’m dreaming, and my reactions decelerate. In slow motion:
the rock smashes my left hand against the south wall; my eyes register the
collision, and I yank my left arm back as the rock ricochets; the boulder
then crushes my right hand and ensnares my right arm at the wrist, palm

silence.
My disbelief paralyzes me temporarily as I stare at the sight of my arm
vanishing into an implausibly small gap between the fallen boulder and the
canyon wall. Within moments, my nervous system’s pain response overcomes
the initial shock. Good God, my hand. The flaring agony throws me into a
panic. I grimace and growl … My mind commands my body, ‘Get your hand
out of there!’ I yank my arm three times in a naive attempt to pull it out. But
I’m stuck.

apocryphal Doubtful, untrue.

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT

Anxiety has my brain tweaking; searing-hot pain shoots from my wrist
up my arm. I’m frantic, and I cry out... My desperate brain conjures up
a probably apocryphal story in which an adrenaline-stoked mom lifts an
overturned car to free her baby. I’d give it even odds that it’s made up, but I
do know for certain that right now, while my body’s chemicals are raging at
full flood, is the best chance I’ll have to free myself with brute force. I shove
against the large boulder, heaving against it, pushing with my left hand,
lifting with my knees pressed under the rock. I get good leverage with the
aid of a twelve-inch shelf in front of my feet. Standing on that, I brace my
thighs under the boulder and thrust upward repeatedly, grunting, ‘Come on…
move!’ Nothing.

This extract from Between a Rock and a Hard Place describes the place where
the accident occurred and the event itself. Aron Ralston describes the events
in great detail. He recreates the scene of the accident effectively. As he is
writing for a general audience, he explains the terminology related to climbing
as well as the reasons behind the different things he does. His clearheaded
and analytical thinking pattern is effectively brought out as well as his ability to
react quickly and to take action in the face of an unexpected problem.
As this is an autobiography, it is written in the first person and has many
factual details that makes it feel authentic. Because it narrates a stressful
situation, the present tense is used. This gives it a sense of immediacy and
makes the reader feel as though they are there with the writer as the events
unfold.

‘YOUNG AND DYSLEXIC? YOU’VE GOT IT GOING ON’
BENJAMIN ZEPHANIAH
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Benjamin Zephaniah has earned widespread respect for his ability to overcome spite, prejudice and
ridicule. Because of his difficulties with reading, his teachers dismissed him as unintelligent and
not worthy of their attention. Rejected by a number of schools, he was unable to read when he left
education at the age of thirteen. Unusually and bravely, he refused to give in to despair, acknowledged
his difficulties and joined an adult reading class. Since then, he has taken an imaginative and
constructive approach to life’s challenges.
In this article from The Guardian newspaper, Zephaniah explains how this happened, from his early
difficulties in school to his determination to write. He performed some of his early work in church at
the age of 11, but found himself with a criminal record two years later. Despite this troubled period, he
has gone on to become a successful poet and writer. His publication within a well-regarded national
newspaper can be seen as an ironic contrast to his earlier life.

writer. Is Zephaniah what you would consider to be a ‘traditional’ writer?

▼ ‘YOUNG AND DYSLEXIC? YOU’VE GOT IT GOING ON’
BY BENJAMIN ZEPHANIAH
This article was published in The Guardian, 2 October 2015, and is adapted
from Zephaniah’s contribution to Creative, Successful, Dyslexic (Jessica
Kingsley, 2015).
As a child I suffered, but learned to turn dyslexia to my advantage, to see the
world more creatively. We are the architects, we are the designers.

normal intelligence.

contradict Challenge what someone has
said.

I’m of the generation where teachers didn’t know what dyslexia was. The big
problem with the education system then was that there was no compassion,
no understanding and no humanity. I don’t look back and feel angry with
the teachers. The ones who wanted to have an individual approach weren’t
allowed to. The idea of being kind and thoughtful and listening to problems
just wasn’t done: the past is a different kind of country.
At school my ideas always contradicted the teachers’. I remember one teacher
saying that human beings sleep for one-third of their life and I put my
hand up and said, ‘If there’s a God isn’t that a design fault? If you’ve built
something, you want efficiency. If I was God I would have designed sleep so
we could stay awake. Then good people could do one-third more good in the
world.’
The teacher said, ‘Shut up, stupid boy. Bad people would do one-third more
bad.’ I thought I’d put in a good idea. I was just being creative. She also had
a point, but the thing was she called me stupid for even thinking about it.
I remember a teacher talking about Africa and the ‘local savages’ and I would
say, ‘Who are you to talk about savages?’ She would say, ‘How dare you
challenge me?’ – and that would get me into trouble.
Once, when I was finding it difficult to engage with writing and had asked
for some help, a teacher said, ‘It’s all right. We can’t all be intelligent, but
you’ll end up being a good sportsperson, so why don’t you go outside
and play some football?’ I thought, ‘Oh great’, but now I realise he was
stereotyping me.

borstal A residential training centre for
young people who are in trouble.

I had poems in my head even then, and when I was 10 or 11 my sister wrote
some of them down for me. When I was 13 I could read very basically but
it would be such hard work that I would give up. I thought that so long as
you could read how much the banknote was worth, you knew enough or you
could ask a mate.
I got thrown out of a lot of schools, the last one at 13. I was expelled partly
because of arguing with teachers on an intellectual level and partly for being
a rude boy and fighting. I didn’t stab anybody, but I did take revenge on a
teacher once. I stole his car and drove it into his front garden. I remember
him telling us the Nazis weren’t that bad.
He could say that in the classroom. When I was in borstal I used to do this
thing of looking at people I didn’t want to be like. I saw a guy who spent all
his time sitting stooped over and I thought, ‘I don’t want to be like that,’ so I
learned to sit with a straight back. Being observant helped me make the right
choices.

percentage of the architect population. If you look at the statistics, I should

be in prison: a black man brought up on the wrong side of town whose
family fell apart, in trouble with the police when I was a kid, unable to read
and write, with no qualifications and, on top of that, dyslexic. But I think
staying out of prison is about conquering your fears and finding your path in
life.
When I go into prisons to talk to people I see men and women who, in
intelligence and other qualities, are the same as me. But opportunities opened
for me and they missed theirs, didn’t notice them or didn’t take them.
I never thought I was stupid. I didn’t have that struggle. If I have someone in
front of me who doesn’t have a problem reading and writing telling me that
black people are savages I just think, ‘I’m not stupid – you’re the one who’s
stupid.’ I just had self-belief.
For my first book I told my poems to my girlfriend, who wrote them down
for me. It really took off, especially within the black community. I wrote ‘wid
luv’ for ‘with love’. People didn’t think they were dyslexic poems, they just
thought I wrote phonetically.
At 21 I went to an adult education class in London to learn to read and
write.
I wrote more poetry, novels for teenagers, plays, other books and recorded
music. I take poetry to people who do not read poetry. Still now, when I’m
writing the word ‘knot’, I have to stop and think, ‘How do I write that?’ I
have to draw something to let me know what the word is to come back to it
later. If I can’t spell ‘question’ I just put a question mark and come back to
it later. The teacher told me, ‘You are dyslexic,’ and I was like, ‘Do I need an
operation?’ She explained to me what it meant and I suddenly thought, ‘Ah, I
get it. I thought I was going crazy.’

accommodate Make adjustments for
someone or something.

oppresses Makes someone feel inadequate
or worthless and limit their freedom.

When I look at a book, the first thing I see is the size of it, and I know that’s
what it’s like for a lot of young people who find reading tough. When Brunel
University offered me the job of professor of poetry and creative writing, I
knew my students would be officially more educated than me. I tell them,
‘You can do this course and get the right grade because you have a good
memory – but if you don’t have passion, creativity, individuality, there’s no
point.’ In my life now, I find that people accommodate my dyslexia. I can
perform my poetry because it doesn’t have to be word perfect, but I never
read one of my novels in public. When I go to literary festivals I always get
an actor to read it out for me. Otherwise all my energy goes into reading the
book and the mood is lost.
If someone can’t understand dyslexia it’s their problem. In the same way, if
someone oppresses me because of my race I don’t sit down and think, ‘How
can I become white?’ It’s not my problem, it’s theirs and they are the ones
who have to come to terms with it.
If you’re dyslexic and you feel there’s something holding you back, just
remember: it’s not you. In many ways being dyslexic is a natural way to be.
What’s unnatural is the way we read and write. If you look at a pictorial
language like Chinese, you can see the word for a woman because the
character looks like a woman. The word for a house looks like a house. It is
a strange step to go from that to a squiggle that represents a sound.
So don’t be heavy on yourself. And if you are a parent of someone with

dyslexia don’t think of it as a defect. Dyslexia is not a measure of intelligence:
you may have a genius on your hands. Having dyslexia can make you
creative. If you want to construct a sentence and can’t find the word you
are searching for, you have to think of a way to write round it. This requires
being creative and so your ‘creativity muscle’ gets bigger.
Kids come up to me and say, ‘I’m dyslexic too,’ and I say to them, ‘Use it to
your advantage, see the world differently. Us dyslexic people, we’ve got it
going on – we are the architects. We are the designers.’ It’s like these kids are
proud to be like me and if that helps them, that is great. I didn’t have that as
a child. I say to them, ‘Bloody nondyslexics … who do they think they are?’

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT

This newspaper article is drawn from Zephaniah’s contribution to a book about
how dyslexic people can be successful. He presents himself as someone
who has found ways of coping with dyslexia, persuading other dyslexics that
they should not regard dyslexia as an obstacle, but as an opportunity to be
creative, rather than restricted.
In a relatively short space, Zephaniah introduces a number of important points.
Mainly, he does this by using short, tightly-written paragraphs so that in a
matter of a few minutes we learn what the author understands as the essential
elements of his coping with dyslexia.

EXPLORING LANGUAGE

KEY POINT

Sometimes, non-fiction writers hold
back from giving their full reaction to
create a space in which the reader can
fill with their own reaction.

An even tone is maintained in the opening paragraphs, despite the fact that
Zephaniah is describing events that troubled him at the time. He reports events
without reacting to them. In this way, readers are encouraged to draw their
own conclusions, and this will make Zephaniah’s points more convincing.
On two occasions, he simply tells readers what he thought when faced with
teacher’s whose comments troubled him. This shows the reader an example of
his reacting without making things worse. Zephaniah shows his self-restraint
when provoked. In his final two paragraphs, he provides encouragement
and a challenge with the striking phrases, ‘creativity muscle’ and ‘Bloody
nondyslexics … who do they think they are?’
A short, introductory paragraph conveys Zephaniah’s conclusion from the
outset and engages with the reader: ‘We are the architects, we are the
designers’. The writing is matter-of-fact and lacks self-pity. From being thrown
out of schools to his appointment as a professor of poetry at a university, he
presents important events in his life in chronological order, to show how he
came to see beyond his troubles as a teenager to turn them into something
positive, from which both he and the reader can learn.

▼ F ROM A GAME OF POLO WITH A HEADLESS GOAT
BY EMMA LEVINE
We drove off to find the best viewing spot, which turned out to be the crest
of the hill so we could see the approaching race. I asked the lads if we could
join in the ‘Wacky Races’ and follow the donkeys, and they loved the idea.
‘We’ll open the car boot, you climb inside and point your camera towards the
race. As the donkeys overtake us, we’ll join the cars.’ ‘But will you try and get
to the front?’ ‘Oh yes, that’s no problem.’
The two lads who had never been interested in this Karachi sport were
suddenly fired up with enthusiasm. We waited for eternity on the brow of the
hill, me perched in the boot with a zoom lens pointing out. Nearly one hour
later I was beginning to feel rather silly when the only action was a villager on
a wobbly bicycle, who nearly fell off as he cycled past and gazed around at us.
Several vehicles went past, and some donkey-carts carrying spectators. ‘Are
they coming?’ we called out to them. ‘Coming, coming,’ came the reply. I was
beginning to lose faith in its happening, but the lads remained confident.

Just as I was assuming that the race had been cancelled, we spotted two
approaching donkey-carts in front of a cloud of fumes and dust created by
some fifty vehicles roaring up in their wake. As they drew nearer, Yaqoob
revved up the engine and began to inch the car out of the lay-by. The two
donkeys were almost dwarfed by their entourage; but there was no denying
their speed – the Kibla donkey is said to achieve speeds of up to 40 kph, and
this looked close. The two were neck-and-neck, their jockeys perched on top
of the tiny carts using their whips energetically, although not cruelly.
The noise of the approaching vehicles grew; horns tooting, bells ringing, and
the special rattles used just for this purpose (like maracas, a metal container
filled with dried beans). Men standing on top of their cars and vans, hanging
out of taxis and perched on lorries, all cheered and shouted, while the
vehicles jostled to get to the front of the convoy.

flouting Breaking.

Yaqoob chose exactly the right moment to edge out of the road and swerve
in front of the nearest car, finding the perfect place to see the two donkeys
and at the front of the vehicles. This was Formula One without rules, or a
city-centre rush hour gone anarchic; a complete flouting of every type of
traffic rule and common sense.
Our young driver relished this unusual test of driving skills. It was survival
of the fittest, and depended upon the ability to cut in front of a vehicle with
a sharp flick of the steering wheel (no lane discipline here); quick reflexes to
spot a gap in the traffic for a couple of seconds; nerves of steel, and an effective
horn. There were two races – the motorized spectators at the back; in front,
the two donkeys, still running close and amazingly not put off by the uproar
just behind them. Ahead of the donkeys, oncoming traffic – for it was a main
road – had to dive into the ditch and wait there until we had passed. Yaqoob
loved it. We stayed near to the front, his hand permanently on the horn and his
language growing more colourful with every vehicle that tried to cut in front.
The road straightened and levelled, and everyone picked up speed as we
neared the end of the race. But just as they were reaching the finishing line,

the hospital gate, there was a near pile-up as the leading donkey swerved, lost
his footing and he and the cart tumbled over. The race was over.
And then the trouble began. I assumed the winner was the one who
completed the race but it was not seen that way by everyone. Apart from the
two jockeys and ‘officials’ (who, it turned out, were actually monitoring the
race) there were over a hundred punters who had all staked money on the
race, and therefore had strong opinions. Some were claiming that the donkey
had fallen because the other one had been ridden too close to him. Voices
were raised, fists were out and tempers rising. Everyone gathered around one
jockey and official, while the bookmakers were trying to insist that the race
should be re-run.
Yaqoob and Iqbal were nervous of hanging around a volatile situation. They
agreed to find out for me what was happening, ordering me to stay inside
the car as they were swallowed up by the crowd. They emerged sometime
later. ‘It’s still not resolved,’ said Iqbal, ‘but it’s starting to get nasty. I think
we should leave.’ As we drove away, Yaqoob reflected on his driving skills.
‘I really enjoyed that,’ he said as we drove off at a more sedate pace. ‘But I
don’t even have my licence yet because I’m underage!’
They both found this hilarious, but I was glad he hadn’t told me before; an
inexperienced, underage driver causing a massive pile-up in the middle of the
high-stakes donkey race could have caused problems.

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT

Emma Levine’s purpose in writing her book was to describe and inform. She
obviously has to engage the reader and hold their interest. As you study this
text, you need to think about how she does this.

SKILLS

CRITICAL THINKING, ANALYSIS

▼ THREE RACES
The passage seems a straightforward description and narrative of the
race, but it isn’t. First of all, there is not just one race happening, but
three:
◼◼ the donkey race
◼◼ the spectators’ race
◼◼ the writer’s race to get the best pictures.
Find one quotation for each of these in order to show that there are
three races taking place.

▶▶ Is the main focus of the reader’s interest the race, or the people
involved in it? What do you think? Find some evidence to support your
point of view.

STRUCTURE

The passage can be defined as a series of linked paragraphs, describing
events in chronological order and concluding with the end of the race and
the writer’s overview of what happened. The internal structure is much more
complex than this simple outline suggests.

KEY POINT

Most newspaper reports of sports races are serious in tone, and try to give the
facts of the race and what it was like. Emma Levine’s purpose is much more
complicated than that. This passage is a mixture of comic writing and serious
reportage, with a lot of information given as well. Consider each of these
elements carefully.

The subject matter of this passage
lends itself to both comedy and drama
and the writer exploits both to great
effect.

BEYOND THE SKY AND EARTH: A JOURNEY
INTO BHUTAN
JAMIE ZEPPA

SUBJECT VOCABULARY

memoir a form of autobiography
landlocked without a coastline

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Jamie Zeppa is a Canadian writer and college professor. Beyond
the Sky and Earth: A Journey into Bhutan is an autobiography that
recounts her experiences on a two-year assignment as an English
lecturer in the 1980s in the mountainous kingdom of Bhutan. It is
a memoir, but it should also be classed as travel writing. It is a
record of the culture and life of a Himalayan village and her initial
reactions and growing attachment to this remote and unexplored
part of the world.
Bhutan is a landlocked country in South Asia and was not
exposed to western influences until the second half of the 20th
century, which enabled it to retain much of its unique identity and
charm. It is a country that has been named the happiest in Asia
and the eighth happiest in the world.

▶

BEFORE YOU START READING
1 Do some research about the history and geography of Bhutan.
2 In groups, talk about what makes your own culture different from that of
other countries. Are there many differences, or only a few? Talk about
the different things that we discuss when describing a culture, such as
language, clothing and practices.
3 Quite often the names of countries and cities have very interesting
stories behind their origin. Share any that you know with the rest of your
class.

Mountains all around, climbing up to peaks, rolling into valleys, again and
again. Bhutan is all and only mountains. I know the technical explanation for
the landscape, landmass meeting landmass, the Indian subcontinent colliding
into Asia thirty or forty million years ago, but I cannot imagine it. It is easier
to picture a giant child gathering earth in great armfuls, piling up rock,
pinching mud into ridges and sharp peaks, knuckling out little valleys and
gorges, poking holes for water to fall through.
Paro A valley in Bhutan that contains the
country’s only international airport.

It is my first night in Thimphu, the capital, a ninety-minute drive from the
airport to Paro. It took five different flights over four days to get there,
from Toronto to Montreal, Amsterdam to New Delhi, Calcutta to Paro. I
am exhausted but I cannot sleep. From my simple, pine-panelled room at
the DrukSherig hotel, I watch mountains, how the landscape resolved itself
beyond the immediate wall in front of you. Flying in from the baked-brown

plains of India this morning, I found out: on the other side of mountains are
mountains, more mountains and more mountains again. The entire earth
below us was a convulsion of crests and gorges and winding sharpened
pinnacles. Just past Everest, I caught a glimpse of the Tibetan plateau, the
edge of a frozen desert 4,500 meters above sea level. Thimphu’s altitude is
about half of that but even here, the winter air is thin and dry and very cold.

The next morning, I share breakfast of instant coffee, powdered milk,
plasticky white bread and flavourless red jam in the hotel with two other
Canadians who have signed to teach in Bhutan for two years. Lorna
has golden brown hair, freckles and a no nonsense, home-on-the-farm
demeanour that is frequently shattered by her ringing laughter and stories of
wild characters that populate her life in Saskatchewan. Sasha from British
Columbia is slight and dark, with an impish smile. After breakfast, we have
a brief meeting with Gordon, the field director of the WUSC program in
Bhutan, and then walk along the main road of Thimpu. Both Lorna and
Sasha have travelled extensively; Lorna trekked all over Europe and North
Africa and Sasha worked for a year in an orphanage in Bombay. They are
both ecstatic about Bhutan so far, and I stay close to them, hoping to pick up
some of their enthusiasm.
Although Thimphu’s official population is 20,000, it seems even smaller.
It doesn’t even have traffic lights. Blue-suited policemen stationed at two
intersections along the main road steer the occasional truck or land cruiser
using incomprehensible but grateful hand gestures. The buildings all have
the same pitched roof, refoil windows and heavy beams painted with lotus
flowers, jewels and clouds. One-storied shops with wooden-shuttered
windows open onto the street. They seem to be selling the same things:
onions, rice, milk powder, dried fish, plastic buckets and metal plates, quilts
and packages of stale, soft cookies from India-Bourbon Biscuits, Coconut
Crunchies and the hideously colored Orange Cream Biscuits. There are more
signs of the outside world that I had expected: teenagers in acid washed
jeans Willie Nelson’s greatest hits after the news in English on the Bhutan
Broadcasting Service, a Rambo poster in a bar. Overall, these signs of cultural
infiltration are few, but they are startling against the Bhutanese-ness of
everything else.
The town itself looks very old, with cracked sidewalks and faded paintwork
but Gordon told us that it didn’t exist thirty-odd years ago. Before the sixties,
when the third king decided to make it the capital, it was nothing but rice
paddies, a few farm houses and a dzong – one of the fortresses that are
scattered throughout the country. Thimphu is actually new. ‘Thimphu will
look like New York to you when you come back after a year in the east,’ he
said.
At the end of the main road is Tashichho Dzong, the seat of the royal
government in Bhutan, a grand, white washed, red-roofed, golden tipped
fortress, built in the traditional way, without any blueprints or nails. Beyond,
hamlets are connected by footpaths, and terraced fields, barren now climb
steadily from the river and merge into forest. Thimphu will never look like
New York to me, I think.
The Bhutanese are a very handsome, ‘the best built race of men I ever saw,’
wrote emissary George Bogle on his way to Tibet in 1774, and I find I agree.
Of medium height and sturdily built, but they have beautiful aristocratic
faces with dark almond shaped eyes, high cheekbones and gentle smiles.

Both men and women wear their black hair short. The women wear a kira,
a brightly striped, ankle-length dress and the men a gho, a knee-length robe
that resembles a kimono, except the top part is exceptionally voluminous.
The Bhutanese of Nepali origin tend to be taller, with sharper features and
darker complexions. They too wear a gho and a kira. People look at us
curiously, but do not seem surprised by our presence. Although we see few
other foreigners in town, we know they are here. Gordon said something this
morning about Thimphu’s small but friendly ‘expat’ community.
When we stop and ask for directions at a hotel, the young man behind the
counter walks with us to the street, pointing out the way, explaining politely
with impeccable English. I search for the right word to describe the people,
for the quality that impresses me the most – dignity, unselfconsciousness,
good humor, grace – but can find no single word to hold all of my
impressions.

master.

Shamanistic religion A religion that has a
belief in natural phenomenon and in powerful
spirits that can be influenced by shamans (a
person who acts as an intermediary between
natural and supernatural worlds).

wood and oil in the Indian subcontinent.

felicitously Pleasingly or well-chosen.
Sanskrit An ancient Indian language.

cordial Friendly and polite.
Ashley Eden An official and diplomat in

Great Game The economic and political
conflict between the British Empire and the
Russian Empire for supremacy in Central
Asia in the 19th century.

In Thimpu, we attended a week-long orientation session with twelve other
Irish, British, Australian and New Zealand teachers new to Bhutan. Our first
class lessons, in Bhutanese history, are the most interesting. Historical records
show that waves of Tibetan immigrants settled in Bhutan sometime before
the 10th century, but the area is thought to have been inhabited long before
that. In the eighth century, the Indian saint Padmasambhava brought to the
area, where it absorbed many elements of Bon, the indigenous shamanistic
religion. The New religion took hold but was not a unifying force. The area
remained a collection of isolated valleys, each ruled by its own king. When
the Tibetan lama, Ngawang Namgyel, arrived in 1616, he set about unifying
the valleys under one central authority and gave the country the name Druk
Yul, meaning Land of the Thunder Dragon. Earlier names for Bhutan are
just as beautiful – the Tibetans knew the country as the Southern Land
of Medicinal Herbs and the South Sandalwood Country. Districts within
Bhutan were even more felicitously-named: Rainbow Districts of Desires,
Lotus Grove of the Gods, Blooming Valley of Luxuriant Fruits and the Land
of Longing and Silver Pines. Bhutan, the name by which the country came
to be known to the outside world, is thought to be derived from Bhotanta,
meaning the ‘end of Tibet’ or from the Sanskrit Bhu-uttan, meaning
‘highlands’.
While the rest of Asia was being overrun by Europeans of varying hue but
similar cry, only a handful of Westerners found their way into Bhutan. Two
Portuguese Jesuits came to call in 1627, and six British missions paid brief
but cordial visits from the late 1700s until the middle of the next century.
Relations with the British took a nasty turn during the disastrous visit of
Ashley Eden in 1864. Eden, who had gone to sort out a small problem of
the Bhutanese raids on the British territory, had his back slapped, his hair
pulled, and his face rubbed with wet dough, and was then forced to sign
an outrageous treaty that led to a brief war between the British and the
Bhutanese. Considering the consolidated British Empire in the south and
the Great Game being played out in the north between the colonial powers,
Bhutan’s preservation of its independence was remarkable. I am full of
admiration for this small country that has managed to look after itself so
well.

This extract gives the reader a vivid description of the writer’s first impressions
of a foreign land. It conveys the way in which the writer’s reaction changes
from an initial lukewarm attitude to a gradual fascination as she begins to learn
about the country’s history and observe its culture.
Travel writing refers to personal accounts of explorations and travel
experiences. This genre contains many factual details. Terms that are specific
to that culture are explained and opinions are conveyed. Like most travel
writing, this extract describes a key event and includes background details and
research that was most likely conducted after the travel experience has ended.

A small amount of humour is added by this

creates an impression that the writer finds some
aspects of what she sees very different from home.

The writer uses lists extensively as a technique. This is particularly
useful because she is describing the varied and fascinating world that
she is being exposed to. Lists can be of two types:
1 syndetic lists – a list connected by the use of conjunctions between
each term, for example, ‘apples and oranges and grapes’
2 asyndectic lists – a list connected by commas, for example,
‘umbrellas, shoes, prams and all sorts of things’. At times, even
the final conjunction ‘and’ can be omitted, for example, ‘articles,

GENERAL VOCABULARY

reader
acuity ability

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Helen Macdonald is a very experienced and enthusiastic falconer.
When her father died suddenly on a London street, she was
devastated. In an attempt to cope with her grief, she decided to
buy and train one of the most difficult and aggressive of birds of
prey, the goshawk. She wanted to absorb herself with the bird
that she would be able to forget her grief. The whole experience
changed her life, leading to the writing of a book about the
process. She said: ‘The book is a memoir about that year when I
lost my father and trained a hawk’.
Macdonald’s book, published in 2013, won the Samuel Johnson
Prize and Costa Book of the Year Award (both highly prestigious
awards in the UK and Ireland). One reviewer, Mark Cocker, said:
‘More than any other writer I know, Macdonald is able to summon
the mental world of a bird of prey… As a naturalist she has
somehow acquired her bird’s laser-like visual acuity’. In addition,
he praised her writing for its verbal inventiveness and precision.

from other birds of prey.
2 Find some pictures of hawks on the internet. Try to think of some words

goshawk with which to go hawking?

‘We’ll check the ring numbers against the Article 10s,’ he explained,
pulling a sheaf of yellow paper from his rucksack and unfolding
two of the official forms that accompany captive-bred rare birds
throughout their lives. ‘Don’t want you going home with the wrong
bird.’
We noted the numbers. We stared down at the boxes, at their parceltape handles, their doors of thin plywood and hinges of carefully tied
string. Then he knelt on the concrete, untied a hinge on the smaller
box and squinted into its dark interior. A sudden thump of feathered
shoulders and the box shook as if someone had punched it, hard,
from within. ‘She’s got her hood off,’ he said, and frowned. That light,
leather hood was to keep the hawk from fearful sights. Like us.
Another hinge untied. Concentration. Infinite caution. Daylight

inside, and amidst a whirring, chaotic clatter of wings and feet and
talons and a high-pitched twittering and it’s all happening at once,
the man pulls an enormous, enormous hawk out of the box and in
a strange coincidence of world and deed a great flood of sunlight
drenches us and everything is brilliance and fury. The hawk’s wings,
barred and beating, the sharp fingers of her dark-tipped primaries
cutting the air, her feathers raised like the scattered quills of a fretful
porpentine. Two enormous eyes. My heart jumps sideways. She is a

flakes under wax on the lines of parked cars; far hills and the heather
on them and miles and miles of sky where the sun spreads on dust and
water and illegible things moving in it that are white scraps of gulls.
Everything startling and new-stamped on her entirely astonished brain.
Through all this the man was perfectly calm. He gathered up the
hawk in one practised movement, folding her wings, anchoring her
broad feathered back against his chest, gripping her scaled yellow legs
in one hand. ‘Let’s get that hood back on,’ he said tautly. There was
concern in his face. It was born of care. This hawk had been hatched
in an incubator, had broken from a frail bluish eggshell into a humid
perspex box, and for the first few days of her life this man had fed her
with scraps of meat held in a pair of tweezers, waiting patiently for the
lumpen, fluffy chick to notice the food and eat, her new neck wobbling
with the effort of keeping her head in the air. All at once I loved this
man, and fiercely. I grabbed the hood from the box and turned to the
hawk. Her beak was open, her hackles raised; her wild eyes were the
colour of sun on white paper, and they stared because the whole world
had fallen into them at once. One, two, three. I tucked the hood over
her head. There was a brief intimation of a thin, angular skull under
her feathers, of an alien brain fizzing and fusing with terror, then I
drew the braces closed. We checked the ring numbers against the form.

It was the wrong bird. This was the younger one. The smaller one. This
was not my hawk.
Oh.
So we put her back and opened the other box, which was meant to
hold the larger, older bird. And dear God, it did. Everything about this
second hawk was different. She came out like a Victorian melodrama:
a sort of madwoman in the attack. She was smokier and darker and
much, much bigger, and instead of twittering, she wailed; great, awful
gouts of sound like a thing in pain, and the sound was unbearable.
This is my hawk, I was telling myself and it was all I could do to
breathe. She too was bareheaded, and I grabbed the hood from the
box as before. But as I brought it up to her face I looked into her eyes
and saw something blank and crazy in her stare. Some madness from

a distant country. I didn’t recognise her. This isn’t my hawk. The hood
was on, the ring numbers checked, the bird back in the box, the yellow
form folded, the money exchanged, and all I could think was, But
this isn’t my hawk. Slow panic. I knew what I had to say, and it was a
monstrous breach of etiquette. ‘This is really awkward,’ I began. ‘But I
really liked the first one. Do you think there’s any chance I could take
that one instead… ?’ I tailed off. His eyebrows were raised. I started
again, saying stupider things: ‘I’m sure the other falconer would like
the larger bird? She’s more beautiful than the first one, isn’t she? I
know this is out of order, but I… Could I? Would it be all right, do
you think?’ And on and on, a desperate, crazy barrage of incoherent
appeals.
I’m sure nothing I said persuaded him more than the look on my face
as I said it. A tall, white-faced woman with wind-wrecked hair and
exhausted eyes was pleading with him on a quayside, hands held out
as if she were in a seaside production of Medea. Looking at me he
must have sensed that my stuttered request wasn’t a simple one. That
there was something behind it that was very important. There was a
moment of total silence.

This extract from the book describes the moment when Macdonald first meets
the hawk she has decided to train. It is a moment of great significance – the
relationship that she builds with this bird is the main topic of the book and is
the method that she adopts for dealing with her grief for her father.
Although the second hawk that is pulled out is the one that she has reserved
for herself, Macdonald makes a very quick decision on instinct. There is
something she does not like about the larger bird and she decides to ask for
the one that the man brought out first. She describes both birds in detail.
This kind of writing is sometimes called ‘creative non-fiction’. This is because,
although it is factual, it is also imaginative and highly-crafted writing. When
you re-read the extract, look out for the same kinds of writing that you get in
fiction – description, narrative, dialogue, thoughts and feelings, as well as more
fact-based explanation.

EXPLORING LANGUAGE

The language of this passage is inventive and intense. It is clear that the writer
was concentrating hard on communicating as vividly as possible an experience
that was important in her life and in the story that she is telling. We can see this
in a number of ways such as in the precision of the vocabulary, the originality of
the imagery (the figurative language); and the variety of sentence structures.
Mark Cocker wrote that Macdonald ‘combines a lexicographer’s pleasure in
words as carefully curated objects with an inventive passion for words or for
ways of releasing fresh effects from the old stock’. Can you see why he said this?

Macdonald is clearly excited about seeing the hawk: you can tell this by the way
she exaggerates, saying that the hawk is ‘enormous, enormous’.

If this is typical of the whole response, it would justify a Level 2 mark with the
following comments.
◼◼ Some understanding of and comment on language and structure and how
these are used by writers to achieve effects, including use of vocabulary.

Macdonald creates excitement through a range of linguistic techniques. Her
language is emotive and figurative, creating a forceful effect. For example,
in the lines beginning, ‘the man pulls an enormous, enormous hawk… ‘the
words ‘brilliance and fury’ express her strong feelings while the repetition of
‘enormous’ shows she is surprised.

CHINESE CINDERELLA
ADELINE YEN MAH
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Chinese Cinderella is an autobiography by Adeline Yen Mah in
which she describes growing up in a wealthy family in Hong Kong
in the 1950s. She is rejected by her stepmother and her father is
a distant, though powerful, character. She spends much of her
time at boarding school.

▼ FROM CHINESE CINDERELLA BY ADELINE YEN MAH
Time went by relentlessly and it was Saturday again. Eight weeks more and it
would be the end of term… in my case perhaps the end of school forever.
Four of us were playing Monopoly. My heart was not in it and I was losing
steadily. Outside it was hot and there was a warm wind blowing. The radio
warned of a possible typhoon the next day. It was my turn and I threw the
dice. As I played, the thought of leaving school throbbed at the back of my
mind like a persistent toothache.

‘Adeline!’ Ma-mien Valentino was calling.
‘You can’t go now,’ Mary protested. ‘For once I’m winning. One, two, three,

good afternoon, Mother Valentino!’
We all stood up and greeted her.
‘Adeline, didn’t you hear me call you? Hurry up downstairs! Your chauffeur
is waiting to take you home!’
Full of foreboding, I ran downstairs as in a nightmare, wondering who had
died this time. Father’s chauffeur assured me everyone was healthy.
‘Then why are you taking me home?’ I asked.
‘How should I know?’ he answered defensively, shrugging his shoulders.
‘Your guess is as good as mine. They give the orders and I carry them out.’
During the short drive home, my heart was full of dread and I wondered
what I had done wrong. Our car stopped at an elegant villa at mid-level,
halfway up the hill between the peak and the harbour.
‘Where are we?’ I asked foolishly.
‘Don’t you know anything?’ the chauffeur replied rudely. ‘This is your new
home. Your parents moved here a few months ago.’
‘I had forgotten,’ I said as I got out.

see you as soon as you get home.’
‘See me in his room?’ I was overwhelmed by the thought that I had been
summoned by Father to enter the Holy of Holies – a place to which I had
never been invited. Why?
Timidly, I knocked on the door. Father was alone, looking relaxed in his
slippers and bathrobe, reading a newspaper. He smiled as I entered and I saw
he was in a happy mood. I breathed a small sigh of relief at first but became
uneasy when I wondered why he was being so nice, thinking, Is this a giant
ruse on his part to trick me? Dare I let my guard down?
‘Sit down! Sit down!’ He pointed to a chair. ‘Don’t look so scared. Here, take
a look at this! They’re writing about someone we both know, I think.’
He handed me the day’s newspaper and there, in one corner, I saw my name
ADELINE YEN in capital letters prominently displayed.
‘It was announced today that 14-year-old Hong Kong schoolgirl ADELINE
JUN-LING YEN of Sacred Heart Canossian School, Caine Road, Hong
Kong, has won first prize in the International Play-writing Competition held
in London, England, for the 1951–1952 school year. It is the first time that
any local Chinese student from Hong Kong has won such a prestigious event.
Besides a medal, the prize comes with a cash reward of FIFTY ENGLISH
POUNDS. Our sincere congratulations, ADELINE YEN, for bringing honour
to Hong Kong. We are proud of you.’
Is it possible? Am I dreaming? Me, the winner?
‘I was going up the lift this morning with my friend C.Y. Tung when he
showed me this article and asked me, “Is the winner Adeline Jun-ling Yen
related to you? The two of you have the same uncommon last name.” Now
C.Y. himself has a few children about your age but so far none of them has
won an international literary prize, as far as I know. So I was quite pleased to
tell him you are my daughter. Well done!’
face In this context, a positive successful
appearance in the eyes of other people.

He looked radiant. For once, he was proud of me. In front of his revered
colleague, C.Y. Tung, a prominent fellow businessman also from Shanghai,
I had given him face. I thought, Is this the big moment I have been waiting
for? My whole being vibrated with all the joy in the world. I only had to
stretch out my hand to reach the stars.
‘Tell me, how did you do it?’ he continued. ‘How come you won?’
‘Well, the rules and regulations were so very complicated. One really has to
be dedicated just to understand what they want. Perhaps I was the only one
determined enough to enter and there were no other competitors!’
He laughed approvingly. ‘I doubt it very much but that’s a good answer.’
‘Please, Father,’ I asked boldly, thinking it was now or never. ‘May I go to
university in England too, just like my brothers?’
‘I do believe you have potential. Tell me, what would you study?’
My heart gave a giant lurch as it dawned on me that he was agreeing to let
me go. How marvellous it was simply to be alive! Study? I thought. Going to
England is like entering heaven. Does it matter what you do after you get to
heaven?

you’re an expert in both Chinese and English, your Chinese is actually rather

will always be having babies. Women patients prefer women doctors. You
will learn to deliver their babies. That’s a foolproof profession for you. Don’t
you agree?’
Agree? Of course I agreed. Apparently, he had it all planned out. As long as he
let me go to university in England, I would study anything he wished. How did
that line go in Wordsworth’s poem? Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive.

In a small group or with a partner, discuss the following questions.

▶▶ Do you think that adults always remember the incidents of their

a book like Chinese Cinderella?

▶▶ Some critics think that characters in Chinese Cinderella are either
all good or all bad, and that very few of the characters are realistic.

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT

Adeline Yen Mah writes to inform, explain and describe. She is writing for a
general audience which may be interested in childhood memoirs, or perhaps
in understanding the culture that Yen Mah comes from. Yen Mah writes in
such a way that we can understand not only what is happening, but also the
emotional impact of each incident in the passage.
The key to understanding the piece is to understand Adeline and her thoughts
and feelings about boarding school and her ambition to travel to England.
Most important of all is her relationship with her father.

IDENTIFYING KEY INFORMATION
In Paper 1, the passages will be non-fiction and one of the
passages will be an ‘unseen text’ which will be unfamiliar to you.
When dealing with the unseen text, you must give yourself plenty
of time to read it carefully. However, you won’t have time to read
and re-read the passage lots of times so try to apply some of the
following active reading strategies.
◼◼ Before you read the passage, read the title carefully and think
about what it suggests. Based on the title, what do you think
the passage may be about?
◼◼ If there are a few lines of introduction, read and consider
these carefully.
◼◼ Read the passage to get a sense of the tone and content.
◼◼ Read the passage again. While you read, use your pen or
highlighter to circle different things of interest. This is to highlight
key words and phrases to help you answer the questions.

TAP IT!

When you read an unseen text for the first time you should TAP it!
◼◼ Type: What type of text is it?
◼◼ Audience: Who is the intended audience? How do you know this?
◼◼ Purpose: What is the purpose of this passage? Is it informing you,
explaining to you or persuading you?

TYPE

You should be able to establish the type of text that you are reading very
quickly. There are three things that will help you here: the subject, the narrative
perspective and the tense.
◼◼ Subject: What is the subject of the text? Is the subject matter aimed at a
particular age group? Where does the text come from?
◼◼ Narrative perspective: If it is a first-person autobiographical narrative,
for example, it is likely to be a personal account. Does it seem to be an
autobiography?
◼◼ Tense: Is it written in the present tense or is it retrospective?

PURPOSE

COMPARING TEXTS

153

A writer will usually have a particular audience in mind when they write. Look
for any clues that might tell you about the intended reader for example.
◼◼ Age: Is the subject matter aimed at a particular age group? Does the
difficulty of the language suggest a certain readership?
◼◼ Knowledge: What do you need to know to make sense of the passage?
◼◼ Tone: What kind of tone is the piece written in? Is the language used
formal or informal?

The main difference between fiction and non-fiction is that non-fiction is
usually written for a precise practical purpose, whereas fiction is usually written
to entertain. You will need to identify the writer’s intention in order to establish
the purpose of a non-fiction text. It may help you to think of these ‘writing
triplets’ in order to give you a system for thinking about purpose.
◼◼ Inform, explain, describe: Is the writer writing to make something clear or
to give information?
◼◼ Argue, persuade, advise: Is the writer writing to discuss an issue or
persuade someone to share their views?
◼◼ Explore, imagine, entertain: Is the writer writing with no other purpose
than to entertain the reader?

Touching the Void is a book by Joe Simpson. It is a true story of how
he and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, set out to become the first
people to climb Siula Grande in Peru. They were nearing the end of
their climb in the Peruvian Andes when a disastrous accident occurred
in which Joe broke his leg. Simon, who was tied to Joe with a rope,
felt that if he did not break free, they would both die. As a result, he cut
the rope supporting Joe and returned down the mountain, believing
Joe to be dead. Although his leg was broken, Joe crawled his way
back down the mountain and was eventually rescued.

WRITER’S TECHNIQUE

Once you are clear about what the piece is about and what the writer is trying
to achieve, you will be able to consider technique. A good writer will have a
range of techniques that they use in order to create effect. You should look for
a variety of techniques but always relate them back to audience and purpose.
A useful way to identify and understand writers’ techniques is to consider the
different levels at which devices are used:

▼ TOUCHING THE VOID
Imagine that the extract from Touching the Void in the previous section
is the unseen passage. What words or phrases in Joe’s account most
vividly shows (a) the pain he suffers as a result of his injuries and (b) his
thoughts and feelings? Comment on the language used in the passage.

ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION

Copy and complete the following table, adding your own example of a word
level feature to comment on. Review the section, ‘Use of Language’ (pp.xxx–
xxx), if you need help thinking about language features in more detail.

▼ EXAMPLE

▼ EFFECT

Simple language

‘He would leave me. He had
no choice.’

Joe’s simple language portrays
the starkness of the choices
available to Simon and how lifethreatening Joe’s injury really is.

Use of direct
speech

‘“You’re dead” “I’m dead.”
Everyone said it… if there’s
just two of you a broken
ankle could turn into a death
sentence.’

Direct speech helps to convey
the immediacy of thought and to
bring other perspectives into the

▼ FEATURES AT SENTENCE LEVEL
The way in which a writer combines words and phrases into sentences
is important. Look again at the extract from Touching the Void,
considering it as a typical unseen passage. Find two examples of
sentence level features that you could comment on. Go back to the
section, ‘Use of Language’ (pp.xxx–xxx), if you need a reminder of
sentence structure features.
HINT

The grammatical construction of a
sentence is called its syntax. This includes
both punctuation and sentence type. For
example: ‘Robbed!’ The syntax of this
exclamatory, one-word simple sentence
evokes a sense of emotion and drama. The
message is conveyed quickly to the reader
and in an emotive manner.

▼ SENTENCE LEVEL
FEATURE

▼ E XAMPLE

▼ EFFECT

Simple sentences

‘My leg!... My leg!’

Joe’s account uses
a number of short,
simple exclamatory
sentences that show the
sudden horror of the
situation. Here, the two
exclamation marks and
ellipsis convey the panic
he is feeling while the
repeated simple sentence
is sharp, mirroring the
sudden pain he feels.

▼ FEATURES AT TEXT LEVEL
The appearance of the text on the page can also be used to create meaning,
such as, the use of subheadings and paragraphing. There will be less to say
about this when analysing some texts; however, always be aware of text
level features how the writer creates an effect at the text level. This can be
an umbrella term to cover aspects of the text you have not yet discussed.
Copy and complete the table, adding examples and explaining their effects.
HINT

Your aim is not simply to identify
techniques, but to explain the effects of
the author’s craft. A weak answer simply
re-tells the events of the passage; a strong
answer comments on the way in which
language is used to create meaning and
prompt reader response.

▼ EXAMPLE

▼ EFFECT

‘I hit the slope...’
‘Joe had
disappeared...’

By using two different perspectives,
Touching the Void allows the reader to
appreciate the horror from the perspective
of the victim and the friend. As such, the
suspense and discomfort is even more
acute as the reader is forced to engage
with Joe’s physical pain but also Simon’s
fear as he believes his friend is dead.

▼ CONSIDERING LANGUAGE
Refer back to the extract from Ellen MacArthur’s autobiography on
pages 59-60. It deals with an emergency she faced on the 44th day of
the Vendée Globe yacht race when she had to replace an essential sail.
How does this passage bring out the thoughts and feelings of Ellen
MacArthur as she sails alone in a race around the world?

KEY POINT

In analysing texts, try to cultivate the
skill of registering effects at different
levels, including the syntax and the
text. This is like zooming in and
panning out.

INDICATIVE CONTENT
MacArthur’s style is unaffected and frank, and seems very powerful because
it is a very personal narrative. The passage highlights the enormous physical
and psychological challenges in sailing alone in heavy seas near Antarctica.
The fact that it is set at Christmas and that MacArthur is female and small,
in comparison with most of the other competitors, makes it seem even more
extraordinary. The challenge seems almost superhuman, but MacArthur’s
narrative shows that she is very human and subject to the same feelings as the
rest of us. This leads the reader to ask what her motivation can be.
There is much use of the first-person pronoun. Other features of style include:
◼◼ use of technical language giving a sense of the reality of the situation,
although this is not overdone
◼◼ straightforward, direct language; active verbs (‘climbed’, ‘worked’,
‘agonised’, ‘streamed’); limited and precise use of adjectives and adverbs;
repeated sentence structure often using a first-person construction
◼◼ use of words, phrases and clauses that suggest struggle, effort or
challenge, such as, ‘the hardest climb to date; there would be no second
climb on this one’

KEY POINT

Ellen MacArthur is known first and
foremost as a yachtswoman, not a
writer, and her style is not ‘literary’ but
it is complex nonetheless.

COMPARING TEXTS

◼◼ many conversational features, such as contractions (‘I’d’), fillers (‘odd massive
wave’), use of the verb ‘to get’ and words like ‘thing’, repetition of words within
a sentence for emphasis, all of which add immediacy to the writing
◼◼ the syntax begins to break down as the passage reaches its climax; she
even breaks into direct speech, as though talking to herself, for example,
‘not far now, kiddo, come on’; this adds to the sense of urgency and
drama and makes the reader feel present
◼◼ occasionally more detailed phrasing, including comparisons, is used, for
example, ‘as if I was stepping out on to the moon’, ‘This is what it must
look like to the albatross’ and ‘I felt like a million dollars’; but most of the
writing is very literal, for example, ‘I couldn’t feel my fingers’
◼◼ strong focus on words that convey detail, for example, describing the
features and equipment of the boat, including the height of the mast, the
weather, the waves; this gives a strong sense of the situation’s reality
◼◼ direct language is used to detail her feelings, for example, ‘agonised’,
‘exhausted’, ‘rallied’; it is also used to convey the physical and psychological
effort required, such as, ‘This was by far the most dangerous part’
◼◼ the strongest phrasing, reflected in the use of more complex words, is
often linked to moments of potential danger, sometimes suggestive of near
panic: ‘a world over which I had no control’, ‘you are a passive observer’,
‘the frustration was unreal’, ‘no time for complacency now’
◼◼ humorous lightening of tone at the end with the reference to Santa.

▼ FROM HOW THE POOR DIE BY GEORGE ORWELL
After some days I grew well enough to sit up and study the
surrounding patients. The stuffy room, with its narrow beds so close
together that you could easily touch your neighbour’s hand, had
every sort of disease in it except, I suppose, acutely infectious cases.
My right-hand neighbour was a little red-haired cobbler with one leg
shorter than the other, who used to announce the death of any other
patient (this happened a number of times, and my neighbour was
always the first to hear of it) by whistling to me, exclaiming ‘Numéro
43!’ (or whatever it was) and flinging his arms above his head. This
man had not much wrong with him, but in most of the other beds
within my angle of vision some squalid tragedy or some plain horror
was being enacted. In the bed that was foot to foot with mine there
lay, until he died (I didn’t see him die — they moved him to another
bed), a little weazened man who was suffering from I do not know
what disease, but something that made his whole body so intensely
sensitive that any movement from side to side, sometimes even the
weight of the bedclothes, would make him shout out with pain. His
worst suffering was when he urinated, which he did with the greatest
difficulty. A nurse would bring him the bedbottle and then for a long
time stand beside his bed, whistling, as grooms are said to do with
horses, until at last with an agonized shriek of ‘Je fissel’ he would
get started. In the bed next to him the sandy-haired man whom I
had seen being cupped used to cough up blood-streaked mucus at
all hours. My left-hand neighbour was a tall, flaccid-looking young
man who used periodically to have a tube inserted into his back and
astonishing quantities of frothy liquid drawn off from some part of his

body. In the bed beyond that a veteran of the war of 1870 was dying,
a handsome old man with a white imperial, round whose bed, at all
hours when visiting was allowed, four elderly female relatives dressed
all in black sat exactly like crows, obviously scheming for some pitiful
legacy. In the bed opposite me in the farther row was an old baldheaded man with drooping moustaches and greatly swollen face and
body, who was suffering from some disease that made him urinate
almost incessantly. A huge glass receptacle stood always beside his bed.
One day his wife and daughter came to visit him. At sight of them the
old man’s bloated face lit up with a smile of surprising sweetness, and
as his daughter, a pretty girl of about twenty, approached the bed I saw
that his hand was slowly working its way from under the bedclothes.
I seemed to see in advance the gesture that was coming — the girl
kneeling beside the bed, the old man’s hand laid on her head in his
dying blessing. But no, he merely handed her the bedbottle, which she
promptly took from him and emptied into the receptacle.

▲ Orwell wrote How the Poor Die in 1929 after
being in hospital in Paris

About a dozen beds away from me was Numéro 57 — I think that
was his number — a cirrhosis-of-the-liver case. Everyone in the ward
knew him by sight because he was sometimes the subject of a medical
lecture. On two afternoons a week the tall, grave doctor would lecture
in the ward to a party of students, and on more than one occasion old
Numéro 57 was wheeled in on a sort of trolley into the middle of the
ward, where the doctor would roll back his nightshirt, dilate with his
fingers a huge flabby protruberance on the man’s belly — the diseased
liver, I suppose — and explain solemnly that this was a disease
attributable to alcoholism, commoner in the wine-drinking countries.
As usual he neither spoke to his patient nor gave him a smile, a nod or
any kind of recognition. While he talked, very grave and upright, he
would hold the wasted body beneath his two hands, sometimes giving
it a gentle roll to and fro, in just the attitude of a woman handling a
rolling-pin. Not that Numéro 57 minded this kind of thing. Obviously
he was an old hospital inmate, a regular exhibit at lectures, his liver
long since marked down for a bottle in some pathological museum.
Utterly uninterested in what was said about him, he would lie with his
colourless eyes gazing at nothing, while the doctor showed him off like
a piece of antique china. He was a man of about sixty, astonishingly
shrunken. His face, pale as vellum, had shrunken away till it seemed
no bigger than a doll’s.
One morning my cobbler neighbour woke me up plucking at my
pillow before the nurses arrived. ‘Numéro 57!’ — he flung his arms
above his head. There was a light in the ward, enough to see by. I
could see old Numéro 57 lying crumpled up on his side, his face
sticking out over the side of the bed, and towards me. He had died
some time during the night, nobody knew when. When the nurses
came they received the news of his death indifferently and went about
their work. After a long time, an hour or more, two other nurses
marched in abreast like soldiers, with a great clumping of sabots,
and knotted the corpse up in the sheets, but it was not removed till
some time later. Meanwhile, in the better light, I had had time for
a good look at Numéro 57. Indeed I lay on my side to look at him.
Curiously enough he was the first dead European I had seen. I had
seen dead men before, but always Asiatics and usually people who had
died violent deaths. Numéro 57’s eyes were still open, his mouth also

open, his small face contorted into an expression of agony. What most
impressed me, however, was the whiteness of his face. It had been pale
before, but now it was little darker than die sheets. As I gazed at the
tiny, screwed-up face it struck me that this disgusting piece of refuse,
waiting to be carted away and dumped on a slab in the dissecting
room, was an example of ‘natural’ death, one of the things you pray
for in the Litany. There you are, then, I thought, that’s what is waiting
for you, twenty, thirty, forty years hence: that is how the lucky ones
die, the ones who live to be old. One wants to live, of course, indeed
one only stays alive by virtue of the fear of death, but I think now, as
I thought then, that it’s better to die violently and not too old. People
talk about the horrors of war, but what weapon has man invented that
even approaches in cruelty some of the commoner diseases? ‘Natural’
death, almost by definition, means something slow, smelly and painful.
Even at that, it makes a difference if you can achieve it in your own
home and not in a public institution. This poor old wretch who had
just flickered out like a candle-end was not even important enough to
have anyone watching by his deathbed. He was merely a number, then
a ‘subject’ for the students’ scalpels.

The text below is an extract from a review of a car, the Capybara when it first
went on sale. Read the extract and answer the questions below.

▼ THE ‘CAPYBARA’ REVIEW
First impressions count for a lot, and unfortunately, the first impression of
the Capybara isn’t great. The styling can at best be described as ‘challenging’
and at worst ‘capable of frightening small children’. Things do get better
on climbing through the oddly proportioned door, but the shocked look of
passers-by acts as a constant reminder of the styling.
So it’s safe to say the exterior is an acquired taste and relocating to the
driver’s seat is recommended. The interior quality is incredibly strong
and suggests the manufacturer’s money has been directed here whilst the
designers were left to play outside. Beautifully finished equipment and
finishes suggest that this is a much more expensive car than it actually is.
Anyone sat in the sculpted seats is likely to feel reassured that they are
experiencing a quality product and have invested their funds wisely.
Inserting the futuristic key into the central console, you are greeted with a
gentle murmur, rather than the expected rasping shout of other cars in this
class. This lack of soundtrack continues as you smoothly drive away. Road
noise is often an issue for small cars, but there is none here.
The longer you spend in the Capybara, the more you can appreciate its
character. This is a happy car, unhampered by its looks and far more focused on
transporting you in comfort and luxury. State of the art safety features including
laser-guided cruise control, ABS+ and a GPS controlled gearbox cocoon the
driver in a relaxed environment that you would expect in luxury cars.
But this isn’t a luxury car, this is a relatively cheap, well-engineered small car
that does its best to defy the first impressions the exterior styling inspires. If
you can look beyond these, you have one of the best small cars on the road.
Remember, first impressions can also be misleading – it’s what’s on the inside
that counts.

Question 3 is the final question of Section A, and it will ask you to compare the
unseen text you have been given with one of the texts from the anthology. This
question is the longest and most complex and represents about half of the
marks available in Section A.

5 STEPS TO SUCCESS
STEP 1: Remember that the essay that you write in response to the question
will be comparative, based on both Text One and Text Two from the Extracts
Booklet. One will be a text from the Pearson Edexcel Anthology, the other will
be a text that you have not seen before. The question is likely to focus on:
◼◼ what the texts are about, key themes and the authors’ conclusions
◼◼ how the authors use of language, character and other effects.
STEP 2: Make sure that you focus on the question. Begin by stating what the
texts are about, both obviously and at a deeper level, considering implicit and
explicit meaning.
STEP 3: Make sure you refer to interesting or relevant points of detail, as a
very general answer will not be as successful. It is not enough to point things
out and ‘translate’ the text; avoid retelling the story and make sure you explain
how the devices and features work, what their effect is on the reader, and
so on. Ask yourself why the author might have used that kind of language,
imagery and so on. Remember: Point – Evidence – Explain.
STEP 4: Draw clear links and contrasts between the texts. Depending on
which texts you are given, you may also be able to draw contrasts and links
within the texts as well. Make sure that you compare and contrast the texts by
using words and phrases such as ‘similarly’, ‘in comparison’ or ‘on the other
hand’.
STEP 5: Quote briefly, using a single word or phrase, to support your
comments. You may refer to a whole paragraph or long section, but do not
copy it out in full. Show that you are quoting by using inverted commas.
Because you should only use short quotations, you should integrate them
into your sentences and introduce them with a comma or colon. Whenever
you quote, always explain in your own words what the quotation means and
comment on its effect, with particular focus on language and structure.

TOUCHING THE VOID

COMPARING TEXTS

163

Touching the Void is an autobiography by Joe Simpson. Unusually for an
autobiography, it is presented from both the perspective of Joe, and of
his climbing partner, Simon Yates, in the first person.
Published in 2003, it is a true story of how he and Simon set out to
become the first people to climb Siula Grande in Peru. However, the pair
are involved in a terrible accident which results in Joe breaking his leg
and becoming separated from his partner. Simon is forced to cut the rope
connecting the pair as he believes Joe to be dead and his only chance of
survival.
Read the following extract that details the accident from both
perspectives.

▼ FROM TOUCHING THE VOID BY JOE SIMPSON
Joe’s account
I hit the slope at the base of the cliff before I saw it coming. I was
facing into the slope and both knees locked as I struck it. I felt a
shattering blow in my knee, felt bones splitting, and screamed. The
impact catapulted me over backwards and down the slope of the East
Face. I slid, head-first, on my back. The rushing speed of it confused
me. I thought of the drop below but felt nothing. Simon would be
ripped off the mountain. He couldn’t hold this. I screamed again as I
jerked to a sudden violent stop.
Everything was still, silent. My thoughts raced madly. Then pain flooded
down my thigh – a fierce burning fire coming down the inside of my
thigh, seeming to ball in my groin, building and building until I cried out
at it, and my breathing came in ragged gasps. My leg!... My leg!
I hung, head down, on my back, left leg tangled in the rope above me
and my right leg hanging slackly to one side. I lifted my head from the
snow and stared, up across my chest, at a grotesque distortion in the
right knee, twisting the leg into a strange zigzag. I didn’t connect it
with the pain which burnt my groin. That had nothing to do with my
knee. I kicked my left leg free of the rope and swung round until I was
hanging against the snow on my chest, feet down. The pain eased. I
kicked my left foot into the slope and stood up.
A wave of nausea surged over me. I pressed my face into the snow,
and the sharp cold seemed to calm me. Something terrible, something
dark with dread occurred to me, and as I thought about it I felt the
dark thought break into panic: ‘I’ve broken my leg, that’s it. I’m dead.
Everyone said it… if there’s just two of you a broken ankle could turn
into a death sentence… if it’s broken… if… It doesn’t hurt so much,
maybe I’ve just ripped something.’
I kicked my right leg against the slope, feeling sure it wasn’t broken.
My knee exploded. Bone grated, and the fireball rushed from groin
to knee. I screamed. I looked down at the knee and could see it was
broken, yet I tried not to believe what I was seeing. It wasn’t just
broken, it was ruptured, twisted, crushed, and I could see the kink in
the joint and knew what had happened. The impact had driven my
lower leg up through the knee joint. …
I dug my axes into the snow, and pounded my good leg deeply into the
soft slope until I felt sure it wouldn’t slip. The effort brought back the

nausea and I felt my head spin giddily to the point of fainting. I moved
and a searing spasm of pain cleared away the faintness. I could see the
summit of Seria Norte away to the west. I was not far below it. The
sight drove home how desperately things had changed. We were above
19,000 feet, still on the ridge, and very much alone. I looked south at
the small rise I had hoped to scale quickly and it seemed to grow with
every second that I stared. I would never get over it. Simon would not
be able to get me up it. He would leave me. He had no choice. I held
my breath, thinking about it. Left here? Alone?… For an age I felt
overwhelmed at the notion of being left; I felt like screaming, and I felt
like swearing, but stayed silent. If I said a word, I would panic. I could
feel myself teetering on the edge of it.

Simon’s account
Joe had disappeared behind a rise in the ridge and began moving faster
than I could go. I was glad we had put the steep section behind us at
last. … I felt tired and was grateful to be able to follow Joe’s tracks
instead of breaking trail*.
I rested a while when I saw that Joe had stopped moving. Obviously he
had found an obstacle and I thought I would wait until he started moving
again. When the rope moved again I trudged forward after it, slowly.
Suddenly there was a sharp tug as the rope lashed out taut across the
slope. I was pulled forward several feet as I pushed my axes into the
snow and braced myself for another jerk. Nothing happened. I knew
that Joe had fallen, but I couldn’t see him, so I stayed put. I waited for
about ten minutes until the tautened rope went slack on the snow and
I felt sure that Joe had got his weight off me. I began to move along his
footsteps cautiously, half expecting something else to happen. I kept
tensed up and ready to dig my axes in at the first sign of trouble.
As I crested the rise, I could see down a slope to where the rope
disappeared over the edge of a drop. I approached slowly, wondering
what had happened. When I reached the top of the drop I saw Joe
below me. He had one foot dug in and was leaning against the slope
with his face buried in the snow. I asked him what had happened and
he looked at me in surprise. I knew he was injured, but the significance
didn’t hit me at first.
He told me very calmly that he had broken his leg. He looked pathetic,
and my immediate thought came without any emotion. … You’re
dead… no two ways about it! I think he knew it too. I could see it
in his face. It was all totally rational. I knew where we were, I took
in everything around me instantly, and knew he was dead. It never
occurred to me that I might also die. I accepted without question that I
could get off the mountain alone. I had no doubt about that.
… Below him I could see thousands of feet of open face falling into the
eastern glacier bay. I watched him quite dispassionately. I couldn’t help
him, and it occurred to me that in all likelihood he would fall to his
death. I wasn’t disturbed by the thought. In a way I hoped he would fall.
I knew I couldn’t leave him while he was still fighting for it, but I had no
idea how I might help him. I could get down. If I tried to get him down
I might die with him. It didn’t frighten me. It just seemed a waste. It
would be pointless. I kept staring at him, expecting him to fall…

ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION

▼ COMPARING JOE AND SIMON’S ACCOUNTS
To help you to develop comparative skills, look back at the Touching the Void extract again in order to make
comparisons within the text. Work with a partner to copy and complete the following table, considering Simon’s
account, then complete the exam-style question below.

▼ WHAT WORDS OR PHRASES IN JOE’S ACCOUNT
MOST VIVIDLY SHOW:
A) THE PAIN HE SUFFERS AS A RESULT OF HIS INJURIES
B) HIS THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS?

▼ WHAT WORDS OR PHRASES IN SIMON’S
ACCOUNT SHOW MOST CLEARLY THE DIFFICULT
DECISION HE FACES? EXPLAIN THE REASONS
FOR YOUR CHOICES.

Joe’s account focuses on pain and shock: agony, panic and fear.
He is obsessed with pain and the extremity of the damage, using
powerful and emotive verbs ‘it was ruptured, twisted, crushed.’ This
uses the list of threes and emotive language to make us ‘feel his
pain’.
Sharp, onomatopoeic sounds, such as ‘bones splitting’ and
‘shattering blow’, using emotive verbs.
Sometimes uncompromisingly direct to intensify sense of reality: ‘the
impact had driven my lower leg up through the knee joining’; ‘we
were above 19,000 feet… and very much alone.’ Sometimes detailed
descriptions involve the reader and put them in his shoes.
Words and images that convey thoughts and feelings vividly and
frankly, sometimes in a sequence that conveys dramatic changes of
mood and thought (paragraph 4: ‘A wave of nausea… I’m dead.’);
phrasing becomes abstract and almost vague at times, suggesting
trauma: ‘something terrible, something dark with dread’; ‘teetering
on the edge of (panic)’.
Uses rhetorical questions, such as ‘Alone? Left here?’. This creates
an atmosphere of uncertainty, putting the reader in his shoes and
creating a sense of drama and suspense.

166 PAPER 1

COMPARING TEXTS

STUDENT A

▲ Joe Simpson’s is a great story of
mountaineering survivial

Joe’s account of the climb is very matter of fact and doesn’t spare us
the grim details of the injury that he sustained earlier in the climb: ‘I
felt a shattering blow in my knee, felt bones splitting, and screamed.’
This indicates that he isn’t really too badly affected currently by the
psychological trauma of his ordeal. In Simon’s account he is also very
matter of fact about the experiences of Siula Grande, but the way in
which he presents it isn’t so horrific, more clinical. As if he isn’t really
there and is just doing a commentary on someone else climbing the
mountain.
Joe’s account of the climb uses a lot more exciting language and a
richer vocabulary to keep the reader interested: ‘Everything was still,
silent. My thoughts raced madly’. Whereas Simon’s account only uses
very simple language and is more factual rather than exciting: ‘I rested
a while when I saw that Joe had stopped moving.’ I think this suggests
that Joe is perhaps more experienced at writing or was more affected by
the incident on the Siula Grande. This helps us to understand that Joe and
Simon aren’t professional writers; I feel that this does take some of the
possible atmosphere away from the story.
In conclusion I think that there really aren’t that many differences
between the two accounts, other than the ones that I have stated. I think
this is because they are both about the same incident and are both
written from the same aspect of climbers.

STUDENT B
Both Simon and Joe use ellipses in their accounts: ‘I kept staring at him
expecting him to fall…’. The ellipses help to add tension and makes the
reader wonder what will happen next. It keeps them on the edge of their
seat and introduces the idea of an unfortunate event, which can help to
build up to a climax point. Simon’s account ends with an ellipsis, leaving
it up to your imagination and making you want to find out more.
This extract consists of two pieces of autobiographical prose narrative
(or monologues) giving different perspectives on the same event.
Relatively short paragraphs follow a sequence of time, but the real
demarcations are provided by crucial developments in thought. The key
to understanding the piece is to appreciate the different ways Joe and
Simon respond to the accident. Though both accounts are very similar in
style, there are significant differences to be explored.
Simon and Joe both use exclamatory sentences in their accounts. ‘My
leg!... my leg!’ Joe uses this in particular to emphasise a thought and
to bring a greater level of attention to the phrase. In this example it

highlights how painful this experience is for him and forces an emotive
response from the reader.
In keeping with this idea, emotive language is used more frequently by
Joe: ‘something dark with dread occurred to me, as I thought about it I
felt the dark thought break into a panic’. The use of words like ‘dread’,
‘dark’ and ‘break’ create a semantic field of horror and sadness.
Unlike Joe’s account, Simon is less emotional and more objective in
considering the situation in hand: ‘I could see it in his face. It was all
totally rational’. The use of short simple sentences helps keep his point
of view very black and white and provokes a less emotional response
from the reader. It seems fitting that Simon, as the observer, is more
pragmatic in his analysis of the situation – the reader is aware that he
feels a responsibility to act and is weighing up his decisions in as calm
and factual a way as he is able to.
In conclusion, the juxtaposition between Simon and Joe’s narratives
illuminates the pathos in the two accounts. The starkly different tones
force the reader to take sides. The reader is more likely to side with Joe’s
emotive and deeply personal account.

PUTTING IT INTO PRACTICE
Prepare for Section A of the Paper 1 examination by answering
questions on an unprepared non-fiction reading passage (Text 1),
drawn from a range of contemporary non-fiction, including
autobiography, travel writing, reportage, media articles, letters,
diary entries and opinion pieces, and questions on a passage
from the anthology (Text 2).

◼◼ All questions are compulsory.
◼◼ Questions will test reading skills: factual comprehension; inference and an
understanding of how writers use language; evaluation of how writers use
linguistic and structural devices to achieve effect and comparative skills.
◼◼ The pattern of questioning consists of short, specific questions on Texts
1 and 2 (separately targeted) followed by a more sustained comparative
question drawing on the two passages as a whole.
◼◼ Questions will be phrased so that they are student-friendly and clear. The
shorter questions will be more factually-based and phrasing more direct,
for example, ‘What similarities and differences… does the writer note?’
or ‘Find four examples of…’. Questions 4 and 5 are longer and will require
more overall interpretation, for example, ‘Show how the writer is successful
in using language to make the situation real to the reader.’
◼◼ Section A is worth 50% of the total marks for Paper 1.
◼◼ Anthologies may not be taken into the examination, but the relevant
passage will be reprinted on the exam paper.
◼◼ Further examples can be found in the Pearson Edexcel exemplar

he were made from polished chocolate’; like it is wearing ‘a pale fawn fur
coat’; ‘sting like a rose thorn’; ‘tail like a string of beads’. The descriptions
personify the scorpions, making them seem out of the ordinary, emphasising
the foreign nature of them and hinting at the danger that lurks within.

character. Note that quotation is not required and observation will suffice.
Answers may include:
◼◼ the boy loves wildlife
◼◼ the boy respects animals
◼◼ he describes the scorpions in loving detail
◼◼ he enjoys the companionship of animals and gives them human
characteristics
◼◼ he does not feel the need to conform and does not share his family’s
view of the scorpions as scary and ugly
◼◼ he respects animals and treats them with care and devotion.
4 Marks awarded for discussion of the writer’s presentation of a war-torn
country in the autobiographical account, considering how information is
conveyed; structure; viewpoint and tone.
Read the following sample student answer and then consider the examiner’s
comments.

George Alagiah has clearly been struck in a powerful way by what he
encountered in Somalia. He wants to make his readers see what terrible
conditions existed there and how fortunate we are to live in such a different
world. He also shows that journalists often just start out by looking for the
best stories they can find. But in this case, the stories affected him on a deeply
emotional level.
The most powerful effect of Alagiah’s writing is the way he focuses on particular
individuals and their tragedies. He describes the death of the ten year-old Habiba
in a graphic way: ‘No rage, no whimpering, just a passing away’. He is also skilled
at creating not only images of the terrible sights he saw but also uses the other
senses to convey the horror, as when he writes: ‘the smell of decaying flesh’.
One of the striking ways he presents his experiences is by drawing attention to a
particular moment or sight. He does this especially when writing about the smile
of the unknown man. His translator’s explanation that he was ‘embarrassed to
be found in this condition’ disturbed him and he could not get it out of his mind.
He also realises that he never even found the man’s name, and feels guilty about
that, too. He almost seems ashamed of his life as a journalist and the way in
which he was normally able to report on such events in a detached way.
Overall, Alagiah communicates to the reader the way in which people in that
situation lack basic necessities and human respect. However, he also reflects on
how he felt to be witnessing and reporting on these events.

EXAMINER’S COMMENTS
This is a well-focused response that makes very thoughtful points about
the writer’s views and experiences. There are excellent examples focusing
on the detail of Alagiah’s language. The writing is accurate, with infrequent
minor errors.

HINT

Aim for economical and relevant use of
quotation in Questions 4 and 5.
Avoid drifting away from the topic or
question – for example, by projecting
modern ideas about animal rights onto your
reading of the scorpion passage.

5 Reward responses that compare how the writers present their ideas about
their experiences.
Responses may include the following elements or points.
◼◼ Both texts describe a memorable experience from a retrospective firstperson perspective.
◼◼ Text One describes an event from a child’s perspective, whereas Text
Two describes a serious event from an adult reporter’s perspective.
◼◼ Text One begins with close, detailed description of the scorpions’
habitat, carefully describing minute details such as the cracks and
moss on the wall and focusing the reader’s view. Text Two begins
with a list of three, a rhetorical device to emphasise the extreme and
difficult conditions of Somalia. This, in turn, emphasises how special the
emotional response that the face he will ‘never forget’ is.
◼◼ Text One has an ominous title which arouses the reader’s curiousity. Text
Two focuses the reader on the idea that this is a report about journeys.
◼◼ Text One builds tension through close, detailed description. The
description of the scorpions as shy but dangerous foreshadows later
events. The use of the word ‘smuggle’ to describe taking the scorpions
into the house suggests an illegal action; something daring and
forbidden.
◼◼ Text One uses metaphorical and figurative language in its description.
Text Two is a piece of journalism and uses careful, predominantly
objective descriptions. They clearly show us the terrible, graphic details.
The writer uses senses and smells to convey the scene, ‘the smell of
decaying flesh’.
◼◼ The structure of Text One situates a lot of high activity during the
final section as a conclusion of the tension built up throughout the
piece. Rapid actions occur, with active verbs and present participles,
‘scuttling’, ‘quivering’, whilst polysyllabic words such as ‘pandemonium’.
Text Two progresses slowly, passing over a number of characters, but
creating suspense as the reader waits for the unforgettable man. There
is a juxtaposition of pain and joy in the description of the man and his
inexplicable smile.
◼◼ Both texts use direct speech to bring in the voices of other characters.
They are both richly populated with voice and character, though the
effect of this contrasts: Text 1 is joyous in its ‘pandemonium’ whilst
Text 2 uses different characters to document the despair, suffering and
isolation of the victims of famine.
◼◼ Style and tone is very different in the two texts. Text 1 uses exclamatory
sentences to give the piece a comedic feel and remind us that we are
viewing it through the excited eyes of a young boy. Text Two has a
serious, morbid tone and creates pathos through its unblinking depiction
of the human suffering caused by famine.

‘transactional writing’

HINT

The examiners want to see how well you
can write, not how much you know about
something.

TYPES OF TRANSACTIONAL
WRITING

▲ Gamers need informative texts

ACTIVITY 1

SKILLS

Transactional writing is non-fiction writing for a purpose: to
inform, explain, review, argue, persuade or advise. Each task
will be aimed at dealing with one or two of these purposes (for
example, ‘to explain’ will involve some informing).
Section B of Paper 1 will give you a choice of one of two tasks of
this kind. Typically, it will present you with a debatable statement in
inverted commas and ask you to write an article, a speech or a letter
in which you express your views. You will have about an hour to plan
and write it and it is worth half of the total marks for the whole paper.
The topic will not require any specialised knowledge. Topics might
include aspects of school life, transport and travel, obvious leisure
activities such as sports and the internet, and aspects of the media.

▶

The six types of transactional writing covered in Section B of the paper can be
defined as follows.
◼◼ To inform: to pass on information (this includes descriptive writing).
◼◼ To explain: to make clear how or why something is as it is.
◼◼ To review: to outline a piece of work, or an event, and comment on it.
◼◼ To argue: to produce an organised sequence of reasons to support a point
of view.
◼◼ To persuade: to convince an audience or reader to think or act in a certain
way.
◼◼ To advise: to give useful suggestions and ideas to help someone or some
people.

Why do we play videogames? The need for play is a primary component of human development and has been
with us since the dawn of intelligence. Even in the brains of animals can be seen the impetus that leads to
play. So, before we tackle videogaming, we should assess why we, as a species, need playtime so strongly.

WRITING TO INFORM

TRANSACTIONAL WRITING

WRITING FOR A PURPOSE: INFORM, EXPLAIN, REVIEW
In many ways, writing to inform is the most straightforward writing
task. Its main requirements are that it should be accurate, clear
and well organised. Explanation also involves giving information, of
course, but there is a greater need to select the information required
and organise it so that you explain the topic clearly. A review informs
us about a product or event and gives us a reasoned opinion on it.
In explanatory text, it is important to think about your readers and make sure
that they will be able to understand what you write.

own challenges.

▶▶ A young person from another country is coming to spend a term at
your school or college. Write to inform them about your school or
college and what happens in an ordinary day there.
Dear Emilja,
Our school is called New City High School. The school has been built on
the outskirts of our town and it is quite a new building. The school has
1200 young people from the age of 11 up to 18. The school site has been
landscaped and there are lawns and trees on it. There are playgrounds and
sports facilities which are very popular.
The day starts at 8.30 am. Most students get there by bus and walk up from
the bus turning point outside the school gates. Registration is from 8.30 until
8.45 with your form teacher. All sorts of things go on in registration time. You
can hand in notes if you have been off sick, or money if you are paying to
go on a school trip. Some days you can go out to the library and return your
books. On Tuesday and Friday there is assembly in the hall. This is where we
have a speech from the Headteacher and sometimes she gives out prizes and
cups to the sports teams that have won. We might have some music if the
choir or the school bands have practised something to play to the school.
Following that lesson 1 starts at 8.45 and what you have will depend upon
your timetable and what day it is.

behind your chair; wait until the teacher has said ‘good morning’; and then
you can sit down. Outdoor coats should not be worn in class. Students are
supposed to take them off and put them on the back of the chair. There is a
cloakroom where they can be left but most students don’t because it is not
very convenient.

WRITING TO EXPLAIN

Any question that contains the word ‘how’ or ‘why’ expects you to do some
sort of explanation. Use clear paragraphs to organise your response. In the 45
minutes that you will have in the exam, you will probably have time to include
four to six paragraphs. Try to link your paragraphs using signposting words
such as ‘firstly’, ‘therefore’ and ‘in addition’.

WRITING TO REVIEW

179

Since reviews are written for commercial publications such as newspapers,
reviews also need to be well written in order to engage the reader. This also means
that the register can change depending on the readership: if the readers are
teenagers, the language will probably be more colloquial and ‘teenager-friendly’.
If you are asked to write a review in Section B, it is likely that it will be about
a book, a film, an event, or a computer game of your own choice. As part of
it, you should describe the overall qualities and effects of the subject that you

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand how to distinguish
between writing to argue,
writing to persuade and
writing to advise, and how to
approach these writing tasks.

WRITING TO ARGUE

TRANSACTIONAL WRITING

WRITING FOR A PURPOSE: ARGUE, PERSUADE, ADVISE
In each of these types of writing, the aim is to persuade the reader
using various techniques. There are many kinds of ‘argue’ question,
but they will generally ask you to do one or both of the following:
◼◼ Present reasons, with evidence, in support of (or against) a
viewpoint.
◼◼ Develop a point of view.
A typical ‘argue’ exam question might be:
‘Some experts believe that a school uniform creates more problems than it
solves and should be abolished in all schools.’
Give your views on this topic, arguing either in favour of school uniform or
against it. Your argument may include:
◼◼ the advantages and disadvantages of uniforms
◼◼ the potential problems caused by uniforms
◼◼ any other points you wish to make.
(45 marks)
Look at the following students’ attempts to begin an answer to this question.

STUDENT A
Some experts say school uniform creates more problems than it solves, i am
going to tell u my views. My first opinion about school uniform is very clear and I
am against the school uniform, School uniforms are horrible,
i hate ours. Teachers say that it is smart but i couldn’t disagree more. It makes
me look fat. And the colour is soo bad it makes u feel ill. There are lots of other
reasons why it is rubbish e.g. it is not cheap and it is not good kwality, they say
that school uniform makes us look the same so nobody can tell the difference
between rich kidz and poor kidz, but u can becos the rich ones still make there
uniform look like designer wear always.
School uniform makes us look like zombies.

STUDENT B
In my opinion, school uniform should not be abolished. This is because it makes our
school look neat and tidy. The ties keep our collars in check, while the shoes make
us look like young businessmen and women. This is important as it helps to build a
healthy relationship for our college which is what we should be striving to do.
In my view, the uniform defines us as a school; it distinguishes from others. I
appreciate that we are not seen as individuals, but it is important that we are
seen as easily recognised out of school and in school. This gives us a sense
of pride and belonging. I think it also makes us behave better; nobody gains
if our school has a reputation for bad behaviour. Moreover, uniform also has

very practical advantages. For instance, we have different ties in our school
for prefects and for other students. This is useful when prefects do their duties
because they are easily identifiable.
Even if you don’t agree with the point of view expressed, it is easy to see that
one of these answers is much better than the other.

▼ WHAT MAKES A GOOD ANSWER?
Ten statements are given below. Five apply to Student A’s work and five to Student B’s work. Read each
statement and put a tick in the correct column depending on whether you think the statement applies to
Student A or Student B.

STATEMENT

STUDENT A

STUDENT B

Sentences are badly punctuated and there are several spelling mistakes.
A wide range of words and sentence structures is used to engage the reader.
Text forms, abbreviations and slang are inappropriately used.
The first sentence repeats the question and there is a limited range of words and sentence
structures.
It is firmly structured in paragraphs and ideas are carefully linked by words and phrases.
The tone is serious and the argument is very logical.
The tone is too informal and ideas are not linked clearly.
The structure is weak and there are no paragraphs.
The spelling, punctuation and grammar are correct.
Points are made clearly, and reasons and evidence are given for them.

WRITING TO PERSUADE

KEY POINT

You can persuade with the ideas
in your argument, but you can also
persuade with intelligent use of
language itself.

To persuade means trying to influence someone to:
◼◼ accept a point of view
◼◼ behave in a certain way.
The first type of question might ask you to argue persuasively in favour of
a statement in a class debate question (for example, ‘Smoking should be
banned in all public places’). The second type of question might ask you to
write a letter to persuade one or more people to do something (for example,
take part in a charity event).
If you want to persuade someone successfully, you will need to use a strong
argument, but you will be even more successful if you use language to make
them agree with you.

Here is an example of a persuasive speech in answer to the following question.

▶▶ How would you persuade the Governors to redecorate the school?
I am here today to tell you that I believe there should be many changes to help students. I know that these ideas will
cost a lot of money but I reckon they will greatly improve the facilities and the atmosphere.
First I believe we should redecorate the school. If we made the place look more pleasant then students will be
happier and they will work better too. In particular the toilets are in urgent need of refurbishment. It would be
a good idea to introduce some new subjects in the curriculum that are more relevant to the students. Teaching
methods need to be looked at, so that students can have more modern ways of learning things.
You could also look into methods of making people want to come to school. Perhaps you could give special
privileges to students who regularly attend. The school rules need to be looked at as many are out of date. Why not
have a special area set aside for smokers, as long as they bring a letter from their parents?

WRITING TO ADVISE

Most of us give and receive advice almost every day. This advice is often
social or moral (for example, how to deal with a personal problem). In general,
in an exam, you will have to:
◼◼ give helpful opinions, suggestions or information to a specified person or
group of people
◼◼ recommend a course of action to someone, perhaps guiding or warning
them.
A question may be worded to combine both these possibilities, but the advice
will almost always be targeted at a specific audience or reader.

HINT

Do:
◼◼ choose words and sentence structures
that will influence your reader
◼◼ use good examples and details to
support your main points.
Don’t :
◼◼ use too many emotive words – this
can have the opposite effect to that
intended
◼◼ use statistics that are obviously
nonsense – this will weaken your
argument!

‘Writing to advise’ is linked to ‘writing to argue and persuade’. If you give
advice to someone, you will also be trying to influence them to follow your
advice, so persuasion and reasoning play a part.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand how to write for
different audiences.

TRANSACTIONAL WRITING

WRITING FOR AN AUDIENCE
The Section B tasks will specify your target audience or readership.
Common tasks have included writing to a school class or assembly,
writing a letter to a headteacher or governors or to a teenager
abroad, and writing an article for a school or local magazine. As a
writer, you need to make decisions about such things as register,
style and tone, all of which will depend on your audience.

▼ THINKING ABOUT YOUR AUDIENCE

▲ Gases that trap heat are building up in
Earth’s atmosphere

Consider the following extracts about climate change. What audience
do you think each one is written for?
1 Highlight any words or phrases that are particularly suitable for the
audience.
2 Circle words and phrases that show the register of the piece of
writing.
3 List the decisions that the writer has made to make the writing
suitable for the intended audience.

EXTRACT A

Certain gases that trap heat are building up in Earth’s atmosphere.
The primary culprit is carbon dioxide, released from burning coal, oil
and natural gas in power plants, cars, factories etc. (and to a lesser
extent when forests are cleared). The second is methane, released from
rice paddies, both ends of cows, rotting garbage in landfills, mining
operations, and gas pipelines. Third are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
and similar chemicals, which are also implicated in the separate
problem of ozone depletion … Nitrous oxide (from fertilizers and
other chemicals) is fourth…

EXTRACT B

People are seeing change all over the world. Arctic sea ice is melting
earlier and forming later. Glaciers are disappearing. Heat waves,
storms and floods are becoming more extreme. Insects are emerging
sooner and flowers are blooming earlier. In some places, birds
are laying eggs before they’re expected and bears have stopped
hibernating.

EXTRACT C

So what’s going on?
For real, all it takes is a couple degrees
Before floods, droughts, and hurricanes are not anomalies
And all these catastrophes become our new realities
Comin’ down on the world just like the Sword of Damocles.

And you can work on stopping global warming with authority.

ACTIVITY 2

SKILLS

ANALYSIS

▼ USING SOPHISTICATED TECHNIQUES TO PERSUADE
Read the following extract from the RSPCA (The Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), which aims to persuade people to
give money to the charity. Charities depend on people giving money to
them so their appeals need to be very persuasive. When you have read
it, copy and complete the table.
Have you ever thought about how the RSPCA is truly amazing?
We’ve been saving animals from cruelty for nearly 200 years. We
lead the world in showing how to live with animals in harmony
and respect. And all because enough people in our country care
about protecting animals from cruelty. Animals cannot speak out for
themselves. So we do.

HINT

Always In the exam think about the
purpose. The words in this charity appeal
have been carefully chosen:
◼◼ to make us feel the horror of animal
cruelty
◼◼ to stress the positive effect that the
RSPCA has on animal welfare
◼◼ to emphasise the importance of
RSPCA inspectors.

RSPCA inspectors have always been the most visible part of our work
to prevent animals suffering. Today our 370 inspectors and animal
welfare officers collect and rescue around 119,000 animals every year.
It seems like people are conscious of animals’ needs, and they are
prepared to bring suffering animals to our attention.
Looking after pitilessly abused and abandoned animals, and finding
them new homes is just part of the daily task we face. For instance,
our 24-hour cruelty and advice line receives over 3,000 calls on
average, every day, that’s one call every 29 seconds. And each week
our inspectors have to investigate around 2,750 complaints about
suspected cruelty to animals. Multiply that by weeks in a month, and
then by every month in a year.
The RSPCA could not survive without public support. Thank you for
helping to make the RSPCA truly amazing!

▼ WRITING TO A FRIEND
Sometimes the context for advice or persuasion is much more personal.
The following extract is by a teenager who has been told by a friend that
she is going to meet someone she only knows from a social networking
site. She is writing to persuade her friend not to go. Would you expect
her style (or register) to be more informal? Why might it use some
conversational features?
Dear Ella, Tabitha
Please don’t shout at me for writing this letter, but I doubt if you would
let me talk directly to you. I know I am being uptight and intruding on
your private life but I am sick with worry, since you told me that you were
going to meet this ‘boy’. We have always been close friends and you have
always trusted me in the past. So listen to me now. What you are doing is
plain stupid. Insane, even.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand how an
appreciation of form can help
you to write what is needed.

HINT

It is unlikely that you will be asked to write
a very chatty letter to a close friend in the
exam, because the examiners want to see
that you can write with a good command of
standard English.

TRANSACTIONAL WRITING

FORM
The form of a text is the set of conventions that distinguish one
type of text from another. Think about what makes a review
different from a news article. Form is partly a matter of layout or
appearance, partly the approach to the content, and partly the
style or the way that the piece is written.
In terms of the content or subject matter, the form of a feature
article requires that all the content is clearly relevant to the topic,
organised in a logical and clear way. In comparison, the form of a
personal letter allows complete freedom to write about anything
of interest to both the writer and reader (though there are still
certain conventions) and not necessarily in any particular order.
In terms of style, a feature article usually needs to be reasonably
formal, whereas a personal letter can, of course, be very casual
and colloquial.

CRITICAL THINKING

▼ IDENTIFYING FORM
HINT

These examples are all in similar fonts
because you are not expected to try to
imitate any of the visual features of the
form in your exam. For example, if you are
writing an article you would not need to
imitate the visual appearance of a large
headline.

Look at the following openings of various pieces of writing.

▼ OPENING A

What’s in a name?
Names, common as many of them are, are like little codes: they tell people
certain things about us, about where we come from.

▼ OPENING B

I expect the weather over there in Lyon is loads better than here in
Canada. You don’t want to be out in the sticks here I can tell you.

PHYSICAL CONVENTIONS OF FORM

In many cases, the layout is the most obvious indication of form. However, it is
unlikely to be the most important aspect of form.

NEWSPAPER
AND MAGAZINE
ARTICLES
KEY POINT

Distinguishing one form of writing
from another goes beyond the sort of
layout differences that one can see at
a glance.

◼◼ Short paragraphs
◼◼ Conform to a series of conventional lengths, for example,
short articles of 600–800 words; full length features of
around 1500 or so words

◼◼ Use headlines and subheadings
◼◼ Short introductory summaries

FILM AND BOOK
REVIEWS

◼◼ Most commonly from 300–700 words, though can be longer
◼◼ Tend to have a punchy or clever headline and sometimes
subheadings

LETTERS

◼◼ If official or business, writer’s address top right and date
below; addressee’s address top left

◼◼ Begin with ‘Dear…’
◼◼ Short paragraphs
◼◼ End with ‘Yours sincerely’ / ‘All best wishes’ or similar,
depending on level of familiarity with the reader

SPEECHES

◼◼ Begin with a form of greeting, for example, ‘Ladies and
gentlemen…’

◼◼ End with a form of farewell, a conclusion suitable to a

spoken address rather than a written one: this could take the
form of thanks to the audience for listening

IDENTIFYING FORM BY ITS
CONTENT

It is the combination of the layout and content that makes forms identifiable.
Even without the layout of a letter, the words, ‘Dear John’, at the start of
a piece of writing would identify it as a letter. Similarly, when we read a
summarising opening sentence such as, ‘Yesterday evening, the Prime
Minister announced that there would be a referendum…’, we recognise it as
the start of a news article.

NEWSPAPER ARTICLES

HINT

You are not expected to lay out an article
as it would appear in print, such as in
columns and with large fonts for headlines.
You are being tested on the way that you
use language, not the visual layout. You
should still include paragraphs or headings
if appropriate, though.

◼◼ Headlines tell us what the article is about in a concise, attention-grabbing
way. For example, it might use wordplay or alliteration and leave out any
words that are not vital to the meaning.
◼◼ A standfirst or summary sub-heading gives more detail, engaging the
reader further.
◼◼ Opening paragraphs summarise the gist of the piece, which is very
different from the opening of short stories or letters.
◼◼ Experts or people involved are often quoted as evidence and to add weight
to an argument.

in nutritional advice about an interesting discovery arising from research. For example, you could write about
aspects of climate change, changes in nutritional advice or a historical finding. If you cannot remember the facts,
then try inventing some. The aim here is to practise the form of your writing, rather than to focus on accuracy.

FILM AND BOOK REVIEWS

◼◼ Title of reviews are usually catchy to engage the reader and indicate the
reviewer’s opinion.
◼◼ A sub-heading gives more details of the reviewer’s opinion.
◼◼ Ratings give an opinion on how good the book, film or event is.
◼◼ An engaging opening paragraph sometimes uses figurative language to
give the reader a taste of what the film or event is like.

Michael Morpurgo’s War Horse is a moving and powerful tale of war from
an unusual perspective. One of the year’s best books for young readers.
The period is that of the appalling horrors of the First World War, in which

A report is a response to a request for detailed information about a place,
institution, event or other project. It differs from a news article because it
requires extensive research into the background and often then gives a
recommendation as to what should happen next. Governments commission
numerous reports on all aspects of modern life as the basis for forming policy
and making decisions. For example, a town council might need a report on the
roads in a part of the town or the way that schools are fulfilling the needs of
the community.

BLOGS

A blog, short for ‘web log’, is a cross between a diary and a personal
magazine. They vary from those written and designed by professional
journalists and other writers, which resemble online newspapers, to very
informal ones written by students or young people. They are found on many
sites on the internet.
This is an example of a blogpost from a blogger who reviews computer games.
Still only available as an early alpha build on Steam, but already immensely
popular, Dean Hall’s bleak, utterly unsentimental zombie survival game is
unbearably tense and atmospheric. Players are pitched together into a stark
landscape, and must survive for as long as possible, ransacking buildings for
guns and food and avoiding the undead. But just as in all the best zombie
fiction, it’s not the rotting monsters you often have to worry about, it’s
the other survivors. Each server houses up to 40 players, all desperately
scavenging for the same meagre supplies. And if you kill another participant,
you can take their stuff. There is a clear benefit to adopting a ‘shoot first’
policy.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ select the right vocabulary
to make your writing more
precise, clear and effective.

TRANSACTIONAL WRITING

VOCABULARY FOR EFFECT
Vocabulary choice improves with reading and practice. When
an author’s use of vocabulary is excellent, it makes the text
engaging and interesting and it makes the writer appear skilful
and authoritative. It is a matter of choosing individual words and
the phrases into which they are combined. When thinking about
vocabulary choice, it can be helpful to subdivide it into different
aspects: register, variety, impact, the context of word, decoration
or colour, signposting.

▶

REGISTER
The register of a text is the way in which vocabulary is chosen for a particular
audience. For example, if you are writing a letter to a friend or giving a talk to
your class, you will use a more informal register than if you are writing a formal
letter to the school governors or headteacher.
SUBJECT VOCABULARY

synonyms different words with similar or
the same meaning/s.

VARIETY
Variety can be achieved by finding alternative ways of saying similar things
or making similar points. For example, you could use synonyms instead of
repetition. Using the same word more than once can make your writing feel
uninteresting and repetitive. Most words offer you plenty of synonyms to
choose from. For example, to avoid repeating the word ‘important’, you could
use ‘significant’, ‘necessary’, ‘needed’, ‘vital’, ‘crucial’, ‘non-negotiable’ or ‘top
priority’.
Using different synonyms is not just for the sake of variety – words of similar
but not identical meaning may suit the content better than others. For example,
the word ‘imaginative’ has different associations to ‘ingenious’, even though
they are not far apart in terms of their meaning.

ANALYSIS, INNOVATION

▼ REPETITION AS A RHETORICAL TECHNIQUE
Repetition can be a good rhetorical technique if it is used skilfully, but
if it is used badly it can weaken the impact of your writing. Rewrite the
following text, replacing the words ‘point’ and ‘people’ with different
synonyms and trying to make the sentences more interesting.
Social networking does have many good points. One is that it helps
friends stay in touch; another point is that you can talk to people
whenever you like, and this helps people in many ways; a third point is
that people can introduce friends to other people very easily.

WORDS IN CONTEXT

Words do not create much impact on their own. They react with those around
them in the mind of the reader. A chain of words may be linked by their subject
matter if, for example, they are taken from the specialist vocabulary of the
topic. A chain of words could also be linked by tone or feeling: for example,
a group of positive words and phrases, or a group of words and phrases that
create a dramatic effect. If you look through any of the texts featured in this
book, you will find examples of different word chains.

IMPACT

Your vocabulary choice can be crucial in creating impact, especially in text
that is intended to be heard, such as a speech. For example, whether you
are aiming to describe or persuade, techniques such as onomatopoeia and
alliteration can add force to a sentence. For example, ‘lead us towards a dark
and desperate situation’ uses alliteration to draw attention to the adjectives
describing the nature of the situation.

EMOTIVE LANGUAGE

Using emotive language can certainly add impact to your argument. For
example, you may be writing about climate change and want to shock your
reader into action. To do this, you need to emphasise the scale of the problem
by choosing a more powerful word than ‘problem’. For example, you could
use ‘catastrophe’, ‘disaster’ or ‘calamity’.
Compare the following sentences. Which one do you think has a greater
impact?
If we ignore alternative energy sources now, we will soon be facing a
problem.

KEY POINT

Using words for impact has to be
judged carefully. Too weak a word and
there is not enough power, too strong
and you risk sounding melodramatic.

If we ignore alternative energy sources now, we will soon be facing
a catastrophe.

CONNOTATIONS

You can guide your reader’s reactions by thinking about the connotations of
your vocabulary choice. Look at the following table. Each of the suggested
adjectives could be used to finish the sentences, as they have similar
meanings, but they have different connotations that may affect your reader’s
response.

The words in the table are also emotive words, meaning that, they trigger
an emotional response and therefore engage the audience. Such words are
essential in storytelling, as well as in writing to argue and persuade.
Using words with particular connotations can be very effective in arguing for
or against a statement. For example, if you are arguing in favour of euthanasia,
you could describe it as ‘a humane method’. However, if you are arguing
against it, you could describe it as ‘a licence to murder. The connotations of
the words ‘humane’ and ‘murder’ will influence the way in which your audience
thinks about the subject.
Look back at pages xxx–xxx to remind yourself of other ways in which
vocabulary can be used for effect.

You can write in favour of the statement or against it. Remember to
choose vocabulary for its impact and for its connotations.

DECORATION OR COLOUR

SUBJECT VOCABULARY

clichés phrases that are used so often that
they start to lose their impact

In writing to describe, you may be used to trying to appeal to the reader’s
senses by including details such as sounds, smells, feelings and or tastes. In
other forms of writing, where you may not use description (for example, when
you are writing to argue), you can introduce similar sensory effects by using
figurative language.
This is why a writer might say that an unpopular idea went down ‘like a lead
balloon’, or that a good leader is a ‘knight in shining armour’. Although both
of these phrases are clichés, they still enliven the writing, and more original
phrases will have a greater effect.

This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand how you can

SENTENCE OPENINGS

The simplest way to ensure variety is to think about the first words of each
sentence and try to make them different from the others. Less-experienced
writers often start their sentences in similar ways, but the following table lists
some different methods of opening your sentences.

I, you, he, she, it, we, they, my, your

‘I write to you as a concerned…’

A preposition
above, behind, between, near, for, with

A present participle (or -ing word)
thinking, watching, caring, making

‘Looking at the state of the parks in our
area…’

An adjective
huge, beautiful, terrible, strange

‘Noisy, threatening lorries rumble past…’

An adverb (usually end in -ly)
happily, unfortunately, unhelpfully

‘Alarmingly, the facts are…’

▶▶ Explain how you think we could improve our efficiency in recycling.

STRUCTURING OF SENTENCES

LONGER COMPLEX SENTENCES
Complex sentences, containing one or more subordinate clauses, are good
for conveying information or ideas, so try using them in explanations and
arguments. They give an impression of fluent thinking, although you should be
careful not to let a sentence ramble as you may lose your reader’s attention).
The following text is an example of a complex sentence. What impression does
it give?
While some people think that global warming is a natural phenomenon that
has happened many times before in the Earth’s history, others, looking hard
at the scientific evidence, are convinced that we are mainly responsible.

PAPER 1

KEY POINT

Concentrate on the ends of your
sentences to make maximum effect.
Short sentences ending with the main
point, or a memorable phrase make
more impact.

TRANSACTIONAL WRITING

199

Many subordinate clauses begin with adverbial conjunctions, such as
‘because’, ‘if’, ‘while’, ‘when’, ‘so that’, ‘after’, ‘before’ and so on. These
conjunctions play an important part in putting your ideas in order and linking
thoughts together in a complex sentence.

ENDING FOR IMPACT
You can structure your sentences to ensure that the main point is emphasised.
The last words of a sentence tend to stand out because they are read or heard
most recently, so it is a good technique to place important words at the end of
a sentence. Compare the following sentences and their endings.
The government can just ignore it, despite all the work and research.
The final insult is that, after all the work and research, the government can
just ignore it.
The second sentence places the main point of the sentence at the end, where
it is emphasised, and is therefore a bit more powerful than the first.

THE LONG AND THE SHORT
Short, punchy, single-clause sentences can add impact to an argument, or add
variety or surprise to a description or piece of information. Short sentences
are particularly effective when they follow a longer multi-clause sentence.
For example, if you used a long and complex sentence to explain a particular
point, you could follow it with a simple statement such as ‘They are right’ or
‘We need it now’ to emphasise the point.

THE IMPORTANCE OF
PUNCTUATION

Write an introduction, using the skills above, to make an impression on
the reader.

Punctuating sentences correctly is not just for the sake of showing that you
can do it. It also directly affects the impact you have on the reader.
One of the errors that many students make is using the comma splice, which is
the name given to a comma used where there should be a full stop, a semicolon or colon, or a comma with a conjunction. For many readers, the comma
splice interrupts fluent reading.

▼ THE COMMA SPLICE

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand how to write
effective openings and
conclusions to your writing.

TRANSACTIONAL WRITING

OPENINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
One of the benefits of planning is that you are less likely to write
a weak or uncertain opening because you have thought about
what you are going to write. A mistake that students can make if
they have not planned their response, is to simply repeat words
from the question with a phrase such as, ‘In this article I am
going to write about…’. Since your reader already knows this, it is
a waste of time and is uninteresting.

OPENINGS

When you read a text, you probably expect the opening to be interesting,
and grab your attention in some way. The following table lists some effective
techniques that you can use to improve your openings.
Which technique you use will depend on the task.

▼ TECHNIQUE

▼ EXAMPLE

A rhetorical question

‘How often do you take action when you feel something ought to be done?’

An arresting or controversial statement

‘It’s not children who need educating about recycling – it’s the grown-ups who ought to
know better.’

A surprising or shocking fact or statistic*

‘The unreleased energy contained in the average dustbin each year could power a
television for 5,000 hours.’

A relevant quotation

‘We live in a disposable society. It’s easier to throw things out than to fix them.’

A short and relevant anecdote

‘I have found it saves money to reuse the plastic containers…’

HINT

Remember that your statistics do not have
to be accurate in the exam; they just have
to sound plausible. However, if you are
writing for homework, you should check
that your statistics are correct.

PLANNING TECHNIQUES

It is very helpful to plan before writing. Once you have a plan, you
will feel more confident that you can write a successful piece and
this confidence will show in your writing. Since you have about an
hour for Section B, you can spend 10–15 minutes planning carefully.

▶

You can plan using spider diagrams, thought clouds, lists and so on: it doesn’t
matter at all as long as it works for you. A good idea to start with is to jot down
the three primary things about any piece you write: the purpose, the audience
and the form. You can base some ideas on this triplet. For example, refer to the
audience, especially when writing a speech; state your purpose clearly; and
use appropriate language for the form. Above all, jotting down your ideas will
help ensure that you don’t forget them.
Once you have planned, the next thing to do is to generate some ideas. One
idea per paragraph is a good start.

following question.

▶▶ Write an article for a local or school magazine on the topic: ‘Not enough attention is paid to the problem of
stress in the lives of modern teenagers’.
A student has used the following table to plan their response to this question. If you choose to use this method,
you do not need to fill out all the rows: five or six should be enough for the essay that you write in the exam.
You will know when your plan is detailed enough, because at that stage you should feel that the essay will be
straightforward to write.

Some exam questions will contain
prompts of this kind. They give a useful
place to start structuring your answer. In
terms of the previous planning table, the
three main points opposite would fit the
‘time perspective’ approach. Notice that,
although this is mainly a piece of writing
to explain, it clearly gives opportunities to
inform, to describe and to persuade.

Main point 1: Present facilities
◼◼ present state: what we have now (e.g. not enough land / can only
accommodate…)
◼◼ poor conditions: e.g. football pitch / tennis court (quote expert views)
Main point 2: Improvements suggested
◼◼ youth centre: redecorate with help of teenagers
◼◼ repair sports pitch: apply for sponsorship from sports company
◼◼ build skateboard park
◼◼ provide more computers and video games in local library
Main point 3: New facilities
◼◼ bowling alley: give an estimate of how much money this could generate
◼◼ café to be managed by volunteers
Conclusion
◼◼ summarise the benefits of suggestions

ACTIVITY 3

hardworking students like your children/students deserve better.

The first reason why conditions must improve is that a poor quality environment
leads to poor quality work. Substandard work restricts students’ chances of
achieving good qualifications. With an under-qualified workforce, the whole
nation will suffer.

Ofsted reports repeatedly expose the grim quality of Britain’s school premises.
Cluttered classrooms, foul toilet facilities and inadequate outdoor space are all
too commonly reported: over 60% of schools operate out of shoddy buildings. It
is time that the school authorities took action.
Some people think that it is not worth providing decent facilities for children.
They think that youngsters are too yobbish to take care of expensive resources.
But I say, how are children ever to learn to value such resources, if they never
encounter them?

attractive, airy buildings . . . Descriptive
detail and several specific ideas give the
demands substance.

Have you ever asked yourself why school are so shoddily equipped? Do you want
your children to be educated in buildings as dreary as the ones you attended? Or
are you prepared to stand up and demand that something is done?
The citizens of a rich and modern state deserve up-to-date conditions in which
to study and work. Your children are the future citizens of such a state and if
we want their best efforts and loyalty to the nation, we must show them that we
value them. How better to do this, than to provide them with schools fit for the
21st century? Didn’t the last Labour government realise this when they started
the Building Schools for the Future project? What a pity that the money ran out
in the recession.
We’re coming out of that now. If we all pull together we can make change
happen. The minimum that our children deserve is this: attractive, airy buildings
with no hiding-room for bullies; adequate indoor and outdoor recreational space;
appealing eating areas, offering a variety of good value, high quality meals and
snacks; sufficient hygienic and well-maintained toilet facilities that no-one
wastes time in queues. Surely you would not settle for less for your children?
Let us demand from our politicians that they tell us what plans they have to
improve schools. If they cannot answer to our satisfaction, then we will not elect
them.

CONCLUSION
Undoubtedly we are agreed that something must be done. Indeed, we are agreed

The people of a rich and modern state need up-to-date conditions in their
schools. Your children are the future of this country and we need to show
them that we value them.
So we need schools fit for the 21st century? We’ve got a few, but where
are the rest?
What we want is: spacious buildings we’re not always bumping into
peoples; plenty of space outdoors too; good food and snacks; better toilet
facilities – these are what you’d like for your children.
If we do something about it we can make things happen. We need to get
our politicians to improve schools, but if they don’t come up with the
goods, then we don’t have to elect them.

It is useful to have a series of questions
in your mind when approaching any
prose text. These are examples, but
you can think of more.

APPROACHING POETRY

READING SKILLS: FICTION TEXTS

TYPES OF TEXT
In the fiction Anthology, you will read a variety of poetry and
prose extracts. You will need to analyse and interpret them in
order to answer questions in the exam.

▶

When you read a prose text, start thinking about it by asking yourself the
following questions.
◼◼ How is the story told?
◼◼ Who is telling it?
◼◼ Where is it located?
Next, considering the features of the text will help you to analyse what the
writer is doing. These could include:
◼◼ setting
◼◼ narrative perspective
◼◼ characterisation
◼◼ descriptive techniques
◼◼ effect, or how it makes the reader feel
◼◼ possible interpretation or interpretations of the text’s implicit meanings.

When you read a poem, you should also start by considering some questions:
◼◼ What is it about?
◼◼ How does it make you feel?
◼◼ What does it mean to you personally?
Them, consider how the poet communicates meaning and feeling. This could
be achieved by:
◼◼ imagery
◼◼ linguistic techniques
◼◼ rhythm and rhyme
◼◼ structure and form
◼◼ possible interpretation or interpretations of the text’s implicit meaning.

What man has made of man.
Through primrose-tufts, in that sweet bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreathes;
And ‘tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.
The birds around me hopped and played:
Their thoughts I cannot measure,
But the least motion which they made,
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

To catch the breezy air;
And I think, do all I can,

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand how to identify
figurative language
◼◼ consider how figurative
language is used for effect in
creating character, atmosphere
and emotion.

READING SKILLS: FICTION TEXTS

FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE
Figurative language is used to create powerful imagery in texts.
It can be used by writers or poets to create atmosphere, mood,
tone and emotion, or to add to our understanding of descriptions
of character or setting.
Figurative language works by making comparisons between two
things. It therefore provides the reader with a strong visual image
to identify with. The most common figurative techniques are
metaphor, simile and personification.

ACTIVITY 1
SUBJECT VOCABULARY

metaphor the transfer of a quality
or attribute from one thing or idea to
another in such a way as to imply some
resemblance between the two things or
ideas: ‘his eyes blazed’ implies that his
eyes became like a fire
simile similar to a metaphor, a description
that says that an object is like an image
rather than that it is the image
personification when something which
is not human is made to sound human by
attributing human qualities to it.

SKILLS

▶

ANALYSIS, INNOVATION

▼ USING FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE
Look at the photos and write your own figurative descriptions of each.
For example: The amber flames leapt and danced. ‘Leapt’ and ‘danced’
are personification, emphasising the active nature of the fire and
likening it to a person dancing. The beach was like a white ribbon of
paper. This simile conveys the colour and shape of the beach.

The following poems are excellent examples of how metaphor can be used in
poetry.

PAPER 2

CONFIDENTIAL: Uncorrected WIP proof, NOT for circulation or distribution. © Pearson Education.

KEY POINT

Similes and metaphors are sometimes
confused. Remember that similes
compare using ‘like’ or ‘as’, while
metaphors make a more direct
comparison of one thing to another. For
example, ‘She’s as fierce as a tiger’ is
a simile, but ‘She’s a tiger when she’s
angry.’ is a metaphor.

FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE IN PROSE

Settings can be used in a text to suggest a mood, ideas or feelings that are
important to our wider reading of a text. Read the following extract carefully,
considering the way in which the setting is described.

▼ FROM LORD OF THE FLIES, BY WILLIAM GOLDING
Ralph disentangled himself cautiously and stole away through the
branches. In a few seconds the fat boy’s grunts were behind him and he
was hurrying towards the screen that laid between him and the lagoon.
He climbed over a broken trunk and was out of the jungle.

▲ Golding sets his story on a remote Pacific
island

The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or
reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet
up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse
grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with
decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of
the forest proper and the open space of the scar. Ralph stood, one hand
against a grey trunk, and screwed up his eyes against the shimmering
water. Out there, perhaps a mile away, the white surf flinked on a
coral reef, and beyond that the open sea was a dark blue. Within the
irregular arc of the coral lagoon was still as a mountain lake – blue
of all the shades a shadowy green and purple. The beach between the
palm terrace and the water was a thin bow stave, endless apparently,
for to Ralph’s left the perspectives of palm and beach and water drew
to a point at infinity; and always, almost visible was the heat.

DID YOU KNOW?

Pathetic fallacy is very similar to
personification. It is usually used to make
inanimate objects or things reflect what
is going on in the scene. For example, if
the weather is hot and sunny, it usually
represents a ‘happy’ story. If the weather
is dark, cold and stormy, you can usually
guess that something bad is going to
happen.

2 Make a Socratic circle and discuss the following question as a class.

▶▶ The island is described as ‘torn everywhere’ by uprooted trees and
shadowed by the ‘darkness of the forest’. Does Golding’s juxtaposition
of this with the beautiful ‘white surf’ and ‘coral lagoon’ around it
forewarn the reader of the events about to unfold?

▲ The things we always carry around with us
can reveal our character

INTRODUCING A CHARACTER

The best way to approach character is to put yourself in someone else’s
shoes or, in this case, pocket!
Create an imaginary character. Think of a few details about them such
as their name, age and job. Now imagine which objects they might
carry in their pocket or bag. Write down or draw at least three of these
and put them into an envelope. You have now created your character’s
‘pocket’ or ‘bag’.
Swap envelopes with a partner. Remove the items from your partner’s
envelope, one item at a time. Try to imagine what kind of person would
own these items. Share your ideas with your partner.
Write a short paragraph about the character that your partner created,
using some of the items in their ‘pocket’ to develop the character.

It is often said that first impressions are the most important, and this is often
true of fictional characters. The following extract from Christopher Isherwood’s
novel Goodbye to Berlin introduces the memorable and quirky character Sally
Bowles.

▼ F ROM GOODBYE TO BERLIN BY CHRISTOPHER
ISHERWOOD
A few minutes later, Sally herself arrived.
“Am I terribly late, Fritz darling?”
“Only half of an hour, I suppose”, Fritz drawled, beaming with
proprietary pleasure. “May I introduce Mr Isherwood – Miss
Bowles? Mr Isherwood is commonly known as Chris.”

“I’m not,” I said. “Fritz is about the only person who’s ever called me
Chris in my life.”
Sally laughed. She was dressed in black silk, with a small cape over
her shoulders and a little cap like a page-boy’s stuck jauntily on one
side of her head:

“Do you mind if I use your telephone, sweet?”
“Sure. Go right ahead.” Fritz caught my eye. “Come into the other
room, Chris. I want to show you something.” He was evidently
longing to hear my first impressions of Sally, his new acquisition.
“For heaven’s sake, don’t leave me alone with this man!” she
exclaimed. “Or he’ll seduce me down the telephone. He’s most
terribly passionate.”

15

As she dialed the number, I noticed that her finger-nails were painted
emerald green, a colour unfortunately chosen, for it called attention
to her hands, which were much stained by cigarette-smoking and as 20
dirty as a little girl’s. She was dark enough to be Fritz’s sister. Her
face was long and thin, powdered dead white. She had very large
brown eyes which should have been darker, to match her hair and the
pencil she used for her eyebrows.
“Hilloo,” she cooed, pursing her brilliant cherry lips as though she
were going to kiss the mouthpiece: “Ist das Du, mein Liebling?” Her
mouth opened in a fatuously sweet smile. Fritz and I sat watching
her, like a performance at the theatre.

Consider the following prompts to help extend your understanding of
characters. You can apply this to the Anthology texts.
How they appear to others: What kinds of words are used to describe their
features, build and clothing? What does the writer want to suggest to the
reader about the character’s behaviour, attitude or interests?
What they do: What can the reader guess about the characters from their
actions and behaviour?
What they say: Does the writer use direct speech? What does this tell us
about what the character thinks, feels or is likely to do?

▼ CHARACTERS IN POETRY

KEY POINT

Understanding character is a critical
part of analysing a text. Authors can
convey meaning through characters’
words and actions and how they
interact with each other. Characters
can also be used to show how a writer
feels about a bigger theme or issue.

Character is not unique to prose; poems often present us with strong
and well-drawn characters. Consider ‘Dulce et Decorum Est’, by Wilfred
Owen and answer the following questions.
1 Why does the poem’s subject remain nameless?
2 How is description of the man used to build up a strong visual image
of him?
3 What do the final two verses tell us about the man’s relationship with
death?
4 How does the poem make you feel about the man?
5 Why do you think Owen wrote this poem?

▼ DULCE ET DECORUM EST, BY WILFRED OWEN
Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs,
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,

But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of gas-shells dropping softly behind.
Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time,
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling
And flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—
Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.

SUBJECT VOCABULARY

SETTING AND ATMOSPHERE

setting the place where something is or
where something happens, and the general
environment
atmosphere the feeling that an event or
place gives you

The setting of a text can tell you a lot about the text and helps to create
atmosphere. If a novel is set entirely in one room, it can evoke a tense,
claustrophobic feeling. A poem featuring open countryside under clear skies
could suggest feelings of freedom and opportunity.

KEY POINT

The setting and the atmosphere it
evokes are important devices used by
a writer in order to influence readers.
Careful choice of language is important
in conveying this.

CONSIDERING SETTING AND ATMOSPHERE
When approaching a new text, identify the setting and atmosphere more
closely by considering the questions below. Does the writer:
◼◼ establish the sense of place, weather, time?
◼◼ create a particular atmosphere? For example, is it tense or mysterious?
◼◼ give details of the setting? How does this link with the atmosphere
created?
◼◼ choose specific vocabulary to create mood? Can you find examples of
nouns, adjectives, verbs which do this?
◼◼ use images or stage instructions to create effects? Are these linked to a
subject or theme?
◼◼ link setting and mood to the action or characters’ feelings? For example, is
a sad scene set in a rainy, windy, open space?

READING SKILLS: FICTION TEXTS

NARRATIVE VOICE
When considering a text, it is important to study and discuss
the techniques and features of narratives, including style, plot,
character, theme, viewpoint, tone and mood. A useful starting
point is to consider the ‘voice’ which is used to tell the story. Is
the story written in the first person (‘I’), or third person (written
from an external perspective from the characters)?

SUBJECT VOCABULARY

first person written from the perspective of
one person – that is, using ‘I’; this differs
from the second person, which directly
addresses the reader (‘you’), and the third
person (‘he’, ‘she’ and ‘it’)
third person using the third person – that
is, ‘he’, ‘she’and ‘it’; this differs from the
first person (‘I’) and the second person,
which directly addresses the reader (‘you’)
narrator a character that tells the story in a
novel, play, poem or film

CONSIDERING NARRATIVE VOICE

DID YOU KNOW?

Second-person narration speaks directly
to the reader, usually referring to them
as ‘you’. This technique is not used very
often but can make the reader feel part
of the story as it invites involvement or
agreement with the narrator.

? we have deleted the
1st ‘to’ in the sentence?
ie: ‘speaks directly to
the reader’!

▶

ACTIVITY 1

▼ FIRST- AND THIRD-PERSON NARRATION:
Whether a text is narrated in the first person or in the third person can
have an impact on how a reader feels about the text. For example, a
first-person narrative is more personal and a third-person narrative is
more detached. Draw up a list of other differences between them.

When thinking about the narrative voice, consider these questions.
◼◼ Does the writer tell the story from a narrator’s point of view?
◼◼ Does the writer give the reader several different points of view?
◼◼ What tone is used? For example, is it urgent, anxious, relaxed, excited?
◼◼ Do you get a sense of the narrator as a character? What details of their
lives are suggested?
◼◼ Is the narrator writing the story about themselves?
◼◼ Can we trust the narrator? Are there any clues that we should not believe
everything that they say?
◼◼ Is a setting and time period established? What kinds of words are used for
this?

When I was a child, I had a wigwam in our back garden: a circle of
thin yellow cotton draped over a bamboo pole and pegged to the lawn.
Every time my parents argued, that was where I went. I would lie on my

printed on its bright decorative border that after a while they began to 5
dance and run, until I wasn’t in the garden any more but out on the plains,
wearing a fringed deerskin tunic and feathers in my hair, just like the

with things, as well as with my mother and father’s bitterness. They
were both archaeologists, my parents: lovers of the past, they had
surrounded themselves with boxes of yellowed papers, ancient
artefacts, dusty objects; the fragile, friable husks of lost civilizations.
I never understood why they decided to have me: even the quietest
baby, the most house-trained toddler, the most studious child, would
have disrupted the artificial, museum-like calm they had wrapped
around themselves. In that house they lived separated from the rest
of the world, in a bubble in which dust motes floated silently like the
fake snow in a snow-globe. I was not the child to complement such
a life, being a wild little creature, loud and messy and unbiddable. I
liked to play rough games with the boys instead of engaging in the
sedate, codified exchanges of the other girls. I had dolls, but more
often than not I beheaded or scalped them, or buried them in the
garden and forgot where they were. I had no interest in making
fashionable outfits for the oddly attenuated pink plastic mannequins
with their insectile torsos and brassy hair that the other girls so
worshipped and adorned.

READING SKILLS: FICTION TEXTS

STRUCTURE
Writers often use a variety of interesting structural devices
to arrange their prose or poems. In the exam, you need to be
able to write about how the Anthology texts are organised,
considering how structure contributes to your understanding and
interpretation of the text.

▶

ANALYSING STRUCTURE

The simplest way to tell a story is in linear fashion, starting at the beginning
and going on until you reach the end. When commenting on the structure of
narrative, consider the following questions.

HINT

BEGINNINGS

When analysing the structure of a text as a
whole, consider the following questions.
• Is the structure linear or does it involve
time-shifts?
• What narrative links are used to
suggest a movement in time?
• Is there a contrast in the tone and
mood between two parts of a text
when time moves?
• How much is revealed about the
characters at any one time? What do
you learn about the characters when
time moves?

◼◼ Is a setting or time period established? What kinds of words are used
for this?
◼◼ Is a character (or characters) introduced? Who are they? What do you
learn about them?
◼◼ Is a theme suggested? What effect does this have on the reader?
◼◼ Is there a narrator? Do they speak in a chorus or commentary (first or
third person)? What is their tone of voice like? For example, is it urgent,
anxious, relaxed, excited…?
◼◼ Is dialogue used? What effect does it have on the reader? For example, is
it entertaining, tense, fast-moving, thoughtful?
◼◼ Is there a prevailing tense (past or present)? What effect does this
have?

SUBJECT VOCABULARY

narrative the story or plot
time-shift moving between different
periods of time

MIDDLES
◼◼ Is a problem introduced? How?
◼◼ Are all the characters behaving the same way that they did at the
beginning? Which ones have changed?
◼◼ Has the setting changed? How does it fit in with the plot? Does it give
added interest?
◼◼ Are there clear links with earlier parts of the story or poem? What are
they? Are they shown through words or actions?
◼◼ Does the writer suggest what is to come? How?

ENDINGS
◼◼ Does the story or poem come to a definite end? Does the writer leave
the reader to guess what happens?
◼◼ Does the book end as you expected? Or is it a surprise, or even a shock,
ending?
◼◼ Does the end echo the opening? Do we return to the same theme,
setting, characters, for example?
◼◼ Is there a moral or message? Have the characters learned a lesson?
Does the author want to tell the reader something?

DID YOU KNOW?

Some writers create interesting effects by
handling time in a more fluid way and not
relying on a simple beginning-middle-end
structure. By using the technique of timeshift, also known as prolepsis, narrative
can work in a non-linear way. This allows
the reader to make connections between
widely separated events. Flashbacks
to the past can change the reader’s
interpretation of events and shifts forward
can give you a glimpse of the future of the
narrative.

girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at
the open window, that something awful was about to happen; looking at the
flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising,
falling; standing and – was that it? – “I prefer men to cauliflowers” – was
that it? He must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had gone

these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull;
it was his sayings one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his

it was! – a few sayings like this about cabbages.

STRUCTURE IN PROSE

READING SKILLS: FICTION TEXTS

NIGHT, BY ALICE MUNRO
Alice Munro (1931–) is a famous Canadian short story writer. She has won
numerous literary awards, including the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013. She
is an innovative writer who made changes to the short story as a genre. Chief
among these is the way she uses time shifts and moves the narrative forwards
and backwards. Character development and how they are coping with life at
different stages is often more important than plot in her stories.

Structure is important when analysing poetry too. You should think about the
following:
◼◼ organisation of the stanzas

◼◼ punctuation
◼◼ rhyme
◼◼ rhythm
Consider how these might lend themselves to create different effects.
Robert Frost (1874–1963) was a popular and critically respected American
poet. His poetry often tackles themes complicated themes about American
people and society through the rural settings of New England where he spent
most of his life. His work is also influenced by the grief and loss he suffered in
his personal life. He won four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry.

Read ‘Out, Out—’ (page xxx–xxx. Make a note of anything that you
notice about the structure of the poem. Consider the points in the bullet
list above.

▲ American poet Robert Frost

The poem consists of a single stanza. It is written in ‘blank verse’, with five
stresses to a line, which is known formally as ‘iambic pentameter’. It also lacks
a formal rhyme scheme. This form suits the conversational tone. The poem
is realistic, shocking and dramatic, so consider how the construction of the
poem helps to achieve these effects.
The importance of the unusual title is something to be discussed. Particularly,
the dash after the repeated word ‘out’ in the title indicates an unfinished
statement.

▼ F ROM THE NO.1 LADIES’ DETECTIVE AGENCY
BY ALEXANDER MCCALL SMITH

▲ Scene from the film of The No.1 Ladies’
Detective Agency

Mma Ramotswe had a detective agency in Africa, at the foot of Kgale Hill.
These were its assets: a tiny white van, two desks, two chairs, a telephone,
and an old typewriter. Then there was a teapot, in which Mma Ramotswe –
the only lady private detective in Botswana – brewed redbush tea. And three
mugs – one for herself, one for her secretary, and one for the client. What
else does a detective agency really need? Detective agencies rely on human
intuition and intelligence, both of which Mma Ramotswe had in abundance.
No inventory would ever include those, of course.
But there was also the view, which again could appear on no inventory. How
could any such list describe what one saw when one looked out from Mma
Ramotswe’s door? To the front, an acacia tree, the thorn tree which dots the
wide edges of the Kalahari; the great white thorns, a warning; the olive-grey
leaves, by contrast, so delicate. In its branches, in the late afternoon, or in the
cool of the early morning, one might see a Go-Away Bird, or hear it, rather.
And beyond the acacia, over the dusty road, the roofs of the town under a
cover of trees and scrub bush; on the horizon, in a blue shimmer of heat, the
hills, like improbable, overgrown termite-mounds.

READING SKILLS: FICTION TEXTS

Everybody called her Mma Ramotswe, although if people had wanted
to be formal, they would have addressed her as Mme Mma Ramotswe.
This is the right thing for a person of stature, but which she had never used
of herself. So it was always Mma Ramotswe, rather than Precious Ramotswe,
a name which very few people employed.
She was a good detective, and a good woman. A good woman in a good
country, one might say. She loved her country, Botswana, which is a place of
peace, and she loved Africa, for all its trials. I am not ashamed to be called an
African patriot, said Mma Ramotswe. I love all the people whom God made,
but I especially know how to love the people who live in this place. They are
my people, my brothers and sisters. It is my duty to help them to solve the
mysteries in their lives. That is what I am called to do.
In idle moments, when there were no pressing matters to be dealt with, and
when everybody seemed to be sleepy from the heat, she would sit under her
acacia tree. It was a dusty place to sit, and the chickens would occasionally
come and peck about her feet, but it was a place which seemed to encourage
thought. It was here that Mma Ramotswe would contemplate some of the
issues which, in everyday life, may so easily be pushed to one side.
Everything, thought Mma Ramotswe, has been something before. Here I am,
the only lady private detective in the whole of Botswana, sitting in front of
my detective agency. But only a few years ago there was no detective agency,
and before that, before there were even any buildings here, there were just
the acacia trees, and the river-bed in the distance, and the Kalahari over
there, so close.
In those days there was no Botswana even, just the Bechuanaland
Protectorate, and before that again there was Khama’s Country, and lions
with the dry wind in their manes. But look at it now: a detective agency, right
here in Gaborone, with me, the fat lady detective, sitting outside and thinking
these thoughts about how what is one thing today becomes quite another
thing tomorrow.

(30 marks)

The writer suggests that life is not easy for the narrator by giving us a detailed look
at Mma Ramotswe’s life. This is evident when the narrator says she only has ‘a tiny
white van, two desks, two chairs’. The asyndetic listing and adjectival description
emphasise her limited number of possessions, which are ‘old’ and ‘tiny’. The word
‘tiny’ suggests that it is too small for comfort, while ‘old’ implies that Mma Ramotswe
does not have the money for new possessions. The author uses emotive language to
demonstrate how much Mma Ramotswe appreciates the smaller things in life, such
as the view and her surroundings.

‘DISABLED’
WILFRED OWEN
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Wilfred Owen is the best known of the English poets who wrote
about their experiences of the First World War (1914–1918). These
experiences had deep effects on the writers, and cost many of
them their lives. Owen was strongly influenced by another officer
and poet called Siegfried Sassoon. They met at Craiglockhart
Hospital where they had both been sent to recover from shellshock. Owen twice said that his theme was ‘war and the pity of
war’. Having returned to his regiment after his time in hospital,
he died in battle in November 1918, just seven days before the
armistice brought the war to an end on 11th November 1918.

‘OUT, OUT —’
ROBERT FROST
BACKGROUND
Robert Frost (1874–1963) was one of the major American poets
of the 20th century. His poetry is based mainly on the life and
scenery of rural New England. ‘Out, Out –’ was published in the
collection Mountain Interval in 1916.
The setting of this poem is a farm. The scenery around the farm
is beautiful, life is too hard for it to be enjoyed fully by the family,
even by the young son, who has to work all day cutting up wood
with a buzz saw. It is believed that Frost based the poem on a real
incident that he read about in a newspaper.

BACKGROUND
Moniza Alvi was born in Lahore, Pakistan. She has a Pakistani
father and an English mother. Her father moved the family to
England when she was very young, and she did not go back to
Pakistan until after her first book of poems had been published.
She worked for several years as a teacher in London and is now a
freelance writer and tutor.

such as ‘Presents from my Aunts’, which will help you to understand her
attitudes toward her Pakistani heritage.
2 Think about what Moniza Alvi says about her background and its links
to her poetry:
‘Presents from My Aunts’ ... was one of the first poems I wrote.
When I wrote this poem, I hadn’t actually been back to Pakistan.
The girl in the poem would be me at about 13. The clothes seem to
stick to her in an uncomfortable way, a bit like a kind of false skin
and she thinks things aren’t straightforward for her.’

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT

This poem describes the poet’s visit to India and the time she had her hand
hennaed by a girl in the bazaar. It was an experience she never forgot.
The poem makes many connections between western and eastern culture. The
‘unknown girl’ seems to stand for the true spirit of India, which has now been
influenced heavily by aspects of western culture (often called ‘westernisation’).
India is seen as colourful and beautiful and this is reflected in the decoration of
the henna pattern, with its complicated peacock design.

THE BRIGHT LIGHTS OF SARAJEVO
TONY HARRISON

GENERAL VOCABULARY

the Balkans a group of countries in southeastern Europe
Yugoslavia a country which separated
into several smaller countries in the early
1990s
ethnic cleansing the action of forcing
people to leave an area or country or killing
them because of their ethnic or religious
identity
siege a situation in which an army or the
police surround a place and try to gain
control of it or force someone to come out
of it

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Tony Harrison was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, in 1937 and is a
leading poet and translator. He has often written about social
issues and sometimes about international issues. He wrote ‘The
Bright Lights of Sarajevo’ when a national British newspaper sent
him to write about Bosnia, a country in the Balkans, in September
1995.
The Bosnian War took place between 1992 and 1995. It was a
bitter conflict between parts of the former Yugoslavia, which
broke out along old national and cultural boundaries at the
beginning of the 1990s. The main division was between Bosnia
and Serbia, but the political situation was very complex. The war
was motivated by ethnic prejudice and Muslims in the region
suffered horrific ethnic cleansing.
The poem is set in Sarajevo, capital city of Bosnia, during the
siege mounted by Serb forces which lasted the entire duration of
the war. Thousands of people died in the city during the siege.

▶

BEFORE YOU START READING
1 The siege of Sarajevo is the longest siege of a capital city in modern
history. Using the internet, do some research into the series of conflicts
that broke apart Yugoslavia.
2 One event that captured the attention of the international media and
people worldwide was the gunning down of a young couple commonly
referred to as ‘the Romeo and Juliet of Sarajevo’. Find out about them.
3 Think about how you would feel if your daily routines became restricted
and it became too dangerous to even go out to buy a loaf of bread. How
would you cope?

The poem is about the devastation and disruption caused by war and the
resilience of the human spirit in the face of this. The poem highlights the
difficulties faced by the citizens of Sarajevo and contrasts this with young
couples whose relationships are slowly progressing in a city that seems to
symbolise death. Harrison also uses references to the couples’ surroundings
to show that, while life will continue in harsh environments, the reality of the
situation is inescapable. He also explores the roots of the conflict, by showing
that ethnic divides disappears into nothing in the shadows of the night.

CONTRAST

contrast a clear distinction between two or
more things

Throughout the poem, Harrison conveys the contrast between the activities
of ordinary Sarajevans and the strange and difficult conditions in which they
live. He does this by presenting everyday activities alongside evidence of the
violence of war.
Some of the techniques used in the language to express this contrast are:
◼◼ associations – hinting at a setting, a situation or feelings by using related
words and phrases
◼◼ contrasting word chains, such as lists of peaceful activities followed by
contrasting vocabulary suggesting violence and war.

STUDENT A
‘The Bright Lights of Sarajevo’ is a poem by Tony
Harrison that is set in the background of the Bosnian
war. This war went on for many years and resulted in
lots of causalities. The writer wants to show that he
is against war and uses contrast for this purpose. The
biggest contrast he uses is colour. He describes the city
in detail as well.

STUDENT B
Set against the Bosnian war, this poem delivers a
strong message about the devastation caused by war
and the way people are able to rise above it. For this
purpose he mainly uses contrast as a technique. Firstly,
he creates the world of Sarajevo by day and by night.
This helps the reader to visualise the contrasting times
of day.

‘Still I Rise’ is a powerful challenge aimed at the people who have oppressed
the speaker and her community. Instead of expressing simple anger at
the unfairness of one group oppressing another, she challenges the very
foundations of oppression by asserting her pride in who she is. She is proud
of herself and her people and implies that this pride is rooted in the strength
and resilience of her people. The similes she uses, of oil wells and diamonds,
assert that the wealth of her innate qualities more than equals the pride
brought by material wealth.
The speaker’s spirit is compared with a force of nature through the use of
vocabulary relating to the natural world. The range of vocabulary varies from
dust, usually seen as worthless but that is overpowering when it rises like
a storm, to moons and suns, sources of light and life with many positive
connotations.
The poem has several themes:
◼◼ racism
◼◼ oppression
◼◼ pride in oneself and one’s background
◼◼ feminism
◼◼ beauty
◼◼ independence.

African-American Christians living in the
southern United States of America

Times of oppression often cause people to react in creative and innovative
ways. Harriet Tubman was an African-American abolitionist who, after
escaping from slavery herself, helped to rescue groups of enslaved
men and women. The route used for these escapes was known as the
Underground Railroad, and the safe houses and helpers on the way were
referred to as ‘stations’ and ‘conductors’. The journeys that Tubman and
other ‘conductors’ undertook were difficult and dangerous and it was
necessary for Tubman to communicate using code. It is thought that
spirituals were used to give instructions to those waiting to escape.
Match the purposes (a–d) with the song lyrics.
a Communicates that the singer is planning to escape.
b When a slave hears this song he knows that he must be ready to
escape.
c This is a set of directions.

STORY OF AN HOUR
KATE CHOPIN
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Katherine O’Flaherty, known by her married name Chopin, was an
American author of short stories and novels. She is best known for
her collection of short stories, The Awakening, published in 1899.
The roles of men and women were very traditionally defined in
the 19th century, and this was common in 19th century writing.
However, Chopin’s stories were daring rather than traditional
and often portrayed women as trapped and unhappy in their
marriages. As a result, she was criticised and her books were
even banned from libraries. She is now known as an important
early feminist writer and admired for her honest depictions of
women’s lives.
Story of an Hour was first published in Vogue in 1894 and is
one of her most popular stories. It tells the story of a woman’s
reaction to being told that her husband has died in an accident.

▲ Kate Chopin, writing in the late 19th century,
was a pioneer of feminist literature

KEY POINT

Kate Chopin’s short stories are notable
for their honest portrayal of women’s
lives in the period.

BEFORE YOU START READING
1 Feminism means supporting women’s rights and the equality of the
sexes. You can find out more about the history of feminism from
reference books or on the internet. You might like to research the
following questions.
◼◼ What law in the UK gave women the right to have their own earnings
and property for the first time?
◼◼ When were women first allowed to graduate from Oxford University?
◼◼ When were women first allowed to vote in UK parliamentary
elections?
2 Kate Chopin’s short stories are widely available online and in print. You
could read more of her short stories, such as ‘Reflections’, ‘Desiree’s
Baby’ or ‘The Storm’, which will help you to understand her attitudes
towards being a woman in the 19th century. You might like to explore
some short stories written by other female authors of the time: Charlotte
Perkins Gilman’s ‘Turned’ (1911) presents similarly unconventional
female characters for the period.
3 Five Stories of an Hour presents five dramatisations of the story each

way. Watch this online and to compare these interpretations with one

▼ THE STORY OF AN HOUR BY KATE CHOPIN
Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was
taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband’s death.
It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that
revealed in half concealing. Her husband’s friend Richards was there, too, ▶

near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence
of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard’s name leading
the list of ‘killed.’ He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by
a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful, less tender
friend in bearing the sad message.
She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a
paralyzed inability to accept its significance. She wept at once, with sudden,
wild abandonment, in her sister’s arms. When the storm of grief had spent
itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.
▲ “... the tops of trees that were all aquiver with
the new spring life.”

There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into
this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body
and seemed to reach into her soul.
She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were
all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the
air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant
song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows
were twittering in the eaves.
There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds
that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.
She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite
motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a
child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.
She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even
a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was
fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance
of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.
There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully.
What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But
she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds,
the scents, the color that filled the air.
Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize
this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat
it back with her will—as powerless as her two white slender hands would
have been. When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her
slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under her breath: ‘free, free,
free!’ The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from
her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing
blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.
She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A
clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial.
She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands
folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed
and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession
of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and
spread her arms out to them in welcome.
There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for
herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence
with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will
upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem
no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.

And yet she had loved him—sometimes. Often she had not. What did it
matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in the face of this
possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest
impulse of her being!
‘Free! Body and soul free!’ she kept whispering.
Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhold,
imploring for admission. ‘Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door—you will
make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven’s sake open the door.’
‘Go away. I am not making myself ill.’ No; she was drinking in a very elixir
of life through that open window.
Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and
summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a
quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought
with a shudder that life might be long.
She arose at length and opened the door to her sister’s importunities. There
was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a
goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister’s waist, and together they descended
the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.
Some one was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard
who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and
umbrella. He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even
know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine’s piercing cry; at
Richards’ quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.
But Richards was too late.
When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease—of the joy
that kills.

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT

GENERAL VOCABULARY

epiphany a moment of sudden and great
understanding or realisation

EXPLORING LANGUAGE

Story of an Hour is about a wife, Mrs Mallard, who has a heart condition
which means that she should not become over-excited. She is told, and
briefly believes, that her husband has been killed in a train accident. The story
documents the mix of the intense emotions, confusion and sense of freedom
that she feels upon hearing this news.
The story describes the epiphany that Mrs Mallard experiences as she
considers her husband’s ‘death’. She comes to the realisation that, although
she sometimes loved her husband, that she is free and happier without him.
She looks forward to her future, rather than worrying about it as she had
before.
We learn that her name is Louise: she has her own identity and is known
by her own, rather than married, name because she is free. She opens the
door to her sister Josephine with a sparkle in her eye and a new sense of
self. They descend the staircase together. Someone opens the door. It is her
husband, Brently Mallard, unharmed and unaware of the transformation that
has occurred with his absence. We hear a scream from Josephine and see the
attempt to conceal the living dead from the view of the heart patient. But it is
too late and Mrs. Mallard’s heart has stopped,
Mrs Mallard’s appearance, status and feelings are described in detail over the
course of the story. Copy and complete the following table, considering her
thoughts and finding evidence to support you.

THE NECKLACE
GUY DE MAUPASSANT
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
This story is translated from French. It was written by Guy de
Maupassant, who lived from 1850 to 1893 and was famous for
his short stories. It is set against the background of 19th century
Paris in France, where society was divided into strict social
classes. Monsieur and Madame Loisel (the main characters) are
not poor, but neither are they rich. They depend on the little money
Monsieur Loisel earns from his minor job with the government.

liveried Part of a uniform, usually a
servant’s uniform.
trinket A small decorative object.

She was one of those pretty, delightful girls who, apparently by some error
of Fate, get themselves born the daughters of very minor civil servants. She
had no dowry, no expectations, no means of meeting some rich, important
man who would understand, love, and marry her. So she went along with a
proposal made by a junior clerk in the Ministry of Education.
She dressed simply, being unable to afford anything better, but she was every
whit as unhappy as any daughter of good family who has come down in
the world. Women have neither rank nor class, and their beauty, grace, and
charm do service for birthright and connections. Natural guile, instinctive
elegance, and adaptability are what determines their place in the hierarchy,
and a girl of no birth to speak of may easily be the equal of any society lady.
She was unhappy all the time, for she felt that she was intended for a life of
refinement and luxury. She was made unhappy by the run-down apartment
they lived in, the peeling walls, the battered chairs, and the ugly curtains. Now
all this, which any other woman of her station might never even have noticed,
was torture to her and made her very angry. The spectacle of the young Breton
peasant girl who did the household chores stirred sad regrets and impossible
fancies. She dreamed of silent antechambers hung with oriental tapestries, lit
by tall, bronze candelabras, and of two tall footmen in liveried breeches asleep
in the huge armchairs, dozing in the heavy heat of a stove. She dreamed of
great drawing-rooms dressed with old silk, filled with fine furniture which
showed off trinkets beyond price, and of pretty little parlours, filled with
perfumes and just made for intimate talk at five in the afternoon with one’s
closest friends who would be the most famous and sought-after men of the day
whose attentions were much coveted and desired by all women.

When she sat down to dinner at the round table spread with a three-dayold cloth, facing her husband who always lifted the lid of the soup-tureen
and declared delightedly: ‘Ah! Stew! Splendid! There’s nothing I like better
than a nice stew...’, she dreamed of elegant dinners, gleaming silverware, and
tapestries which peopled the walls with mythical characters and strange birds
in enchanted forests; she dreamed of exquisite dishes served on fabulous
china plates, of pretty compliments whispered into willing ears and received
with Sphinx-like smiles over the pink flesh of a trout or the wings of a hazel
hen.
She had no fine dresses, no jewellery, nothing. And that was all she cared
about; she felt that God had made her for such things. She would have given
anything to be popular, envied, attractive, and in demand.
She had a friend who was rich, a friend from her convent days, on whom she
never called now, for she was always so unhappy afterwards. Sometimes, for
days on end, she would weep tears of sorrow, regret, despair, and anguish.

She tore the paper flap eagerly and extracted a printed card bearing these
words:
The Minister of Education and Madame Georges Ramponneau request the
pleasure of the company of Monsieur and Madame Loisel at the Ministry
Buildings on the evening of 18 January.
Instead of being delighted as her husband had hoped, she tossed the
invitation peevishly onto the table and muttered: ‘What earthly use is that to
me?’
‘But, darling, I thought you’d be happy. You never go anywhere and it’s an
opportunity, a splendid opportunity! I had the dickens of a job getting hold
of an invite. Everybody’s after them; they’re very much in demand and not
many are handed out to us clerks. You’ll be able to see all the big nobs there.’
She looked at him irritably and said shortly: ‘And what am I supposed to
wear if I do go?’
He had not thought of that. He blustered: ‘What about the dress you wear
for the theatre? It looks all right to me…’ The words died in his throat. He
was totally disconcerted and dismayed by the sight of his wife who had
begun to cry. Two large tears rolled slowly out of the corners of her eyes and
down towards the sides of her mouth.
‘What’s up?’ he stammered. ‘What’s the matter?’
Making a supreme effort, she controlled her sorrows and, wiping her damp
cheeks, replied quite calmly: ‘Nothing. It’s just that I haven’t got anything to
wear and consequently I shan’t be going to any reception. Give the invite to
one of your colleagues with a wife who is better off for clothes than I am.’
He was devastated. He went on: ‘Oh come on, Mathilde. Look, what could it

how much she could decently ask for without drawing an immediate refusal
and pained protests from her husband who was careful with his money.
Finally, after some hesitation, she said: ‘I can’t say precisely, but I daresay I
could get by on four hundred francs.’
He turned slightly pale, for he had been setting aside just that amount to buy
a gun and finance hunting trips the following summer in the flat landscape
around Nanterre with a few friends who went shooting larks there on
Sundays. But he said: ‘Very well. I’ll give you your four hundred francs. But
do try and get a decent dress.’
The day of the reception drew near and Madame Loisel appeared sad,
worried, anxious. Yet all her clothes were ready. One evening her husband
said: ‘What’s up? You haven’t half been acting funny these last few days.’
She replied: ‘It vexes me that I haven’t got a single piece of jewellery, not one
stone, that I can put on. I’ll look like a church mouse. I’d almost as soon not
go to the reception.’
‘Wear a posy,’ he said. ‘It’s all the rage this year. You could get two or three
magnificent roses for ten francs.’
She was not convinced. ‘No. There’s nothing so humiliating as to look poor
when you’re with women who are rich.’
But her husband exclaimed: ‘You aren’t half silly! Look, go and see your
friend, Madame Forestier, and ask her to lend you some jewellery. You know
her well enough for that.’
She gave a delighted cry: ‘You’re right! I never thought of that!’
The next day she called on her friend and told her all about her problem.
Madame Forestier went over to a mirror-fronted wardrobe, took out a large
casket, brought it over, unlocked it, and said to Madame Loisel: ‘Choose
whatever you like.’

Venetian From Venice, in Italy.

At first she saw bracelets, then a rope of pearls and a Venetian cross made
of gold and diamonds admirably fashioned. She tried on the necklaces in the
mirror, and could hardly bear to take them off and give them back. She kept
asking: ‘Have you got anything else?’
‘Yes, of course. Just look. I can’t say what sort of thing you’ll like best.’
All of a sudden, in a black satinwood case, she found a magnificent diamond
necklace, and her heart began to beat with immoderate desire. Her hands
shook as she picked it up. She fastened it around her throat over her
high-necked dress and sat looking at herself in rapture. Then, diffidently,
apprehensively, she asked: ‘Can you lend me this? Nothing else. Just this.’
‘But of course.’
She threw her arms around her friend, kissed her extravagantly, and then ran
home, taking her treasure with her.
The day of the reception arrived. Madame Loisel was a success. She was the
prettiest woman there, elegant, graceful, radiant, and wonderfully happy. All
the men looked at her, enquired who she was, and asked to be introduced.
All the cabinet secretaries and under-secretaries wanted to waltz with her. She

She danced ecstatically, wildly, intoxicated with pleasure, giving no thought
to anything else, swept along on her victorious beauty and glorious success,
and floating on a cloud of happiness composed of the homage, admiration,
and desire she evoked and the kind of complete and utter triumph which is
so sweet to a woman’s heart.
She left at about four in the morning. Since midnight her husband had been
dozing in a small, empty side-room with three other men whose wives were
having an enjoyable time.
He helped her on with her coat which he had fetched when it was time to
go, a modest, everyday coat, a commonplace coat violently at odds with
the elegance of her dress. It brought her down to earth, and she would have
preferred to slip away quietly and avoid being noticed by the other women
who were being arrayed in rich furs. But Loisel grabbed her by the arm: ‘Wait
a sec. You’ll catch cold outside. I’ll go and get a cab.’
But she refused to listen and ran quickly down the stairs. When they were
outside in the street, there was no cab in sight. They began looking for one,
hailing all the cabbies they saw driving by in the distance.

Seine The river that runs through Paris.
hackney cab An early form of taxi.

They walked down to the Seine in desperation, shivering with cold. There,
on the embankment, they at last found one of those aged nocturnal hackney
cabs which only emerge in Paris after dusk, as if ashamed to parade their
poverty in the full light of day. It bore them back to their front door in the
rue des Martyrs, and they walked sadly up to their apartment. For her it was
all over, while he was thinking that he would have to be at the Ministry at
ten.
Standing in front of the mirror, she took off the coat she had been wearing
over her shoulders, to get a last look at herself in all her glory. Suddenly she
gave a cry. The necklace was no longer round her throat!
Her husband, who was already half undressed, asked: ‘What’s up?’
She turned to him in a panic: ‘I… I… Madame Forestier’s necklace… I
haven’t got it!’
He straightened up as if thunderstruck: ‘What?… But… You can’t have lost
it!’
They looked in the pleats of her dress, in the folds of her coat, and in her
pockets. They looked everywhere. They did not find it.
‘Are you sure you still had it when you left the ballroom?’ he asked.
‘Yes, I remember fingering it in the entrance hall.’

▲ “... her heart began to beat with immoderate
desire”

‘But if you’d lost it in the street, we’d have heard it fall. So it must be in the
cab.’
‘That’s right. That’s probably it. Did you get his number?’
‘No. Did you happen to notice it?’
‘No.’
They looked at each other in dismay. Finally Loisel got dressed again. ‘I’m
going to go back the way we came,’ he said, ‘to see if I can find it.’ He went
out. She remained as she was, still wearing her evening gown, not having the
strength to go to bed, sitting disconsolately on a chair by the empty grate,

her mind a blank.
Her husband returned at about seven o’clock. He had found nothing.
He went to the police station, called at newspaper offices where he
advertised a reward, toured the cab companies, and tried anywhere where
the faintest of hopes led him. She waited for him all day long in the same
distracted condition, thinking of the appalling catastrophe which had
befallen them.
Loisel came back that evening, hollow-cheeked and very pale. He had not
come up with anything.
‘Look,’ he said, ‘you’ll have to write to your friend and say you broke the
catch on her necklace and you are getting it repaired. That’ll give us time to
work out what we’ll have to do.’
She wrote to his dictation.
A week later they had lost all hope.
Loisel, who had aged five years, said: ‘We’ll have to start thinking about
replacing the necklace.’
The next day they took the case in which it had come and called on the
jeweller whose name was inside. He looked through his order book.
‘It wasn’t me that sold the actual necklace. I only supplied the case.’
After this, they trailed round jeweller’s shops, looking for a necklace just
like the other one, trying to remember it, and both ill with worry and
anxiety.
In a shop in the Palais Royal they found a diamond collar which they
thought was identical to the one they were looking for. It cost forty thousand
francs. The jeweller was prepared to let them have it for thirty-six.
▲ Shops in Palais Royale, Paris

They asked him not to sell it for three days. And they got him to agree to
take it back for thirty-four thousand if the one that had been lost turned up
before the end of February.
Loisel had eighteen thousand francs which his father had left him. He would
have to borrow the rest.
He borrowed the money, a thousand francs here, five hundred there,
sometimes a hundred and as little as sixty. He signed notes, agreed to pay
exorbitant rates of interest, resorted to usurers and the whole tribe of
moneylenders. He mortgaged the rest of his life, signed papers without
knowing if he would ever be able to honour his commitments, and then, sick
with worry about the future, the grim poverty which stood ready to pounce,
and the prospect of all the physical privation and mental torture ahead,
he went round to the jeweller’s to get the new necklace with the thirty-six
thousand francs which he put on the counter.
When Madame Loisel took it round, Madame Forestier said in a huff: ‘You
ought really to have brought it back sooner. I might have needed it.’
She did not open the case, as her friend had feared she might. If she had
noticed the substitution, what would she have thought? What would she
have said? Would she not have concluded she was a thief?

Then began for Madame Loisel the grindingly horrible life of the very poor.
But quickly and heroically, she resigned herself to what she could not alter:
their appalling debt would have to be repaid. She was determined to pay.
They dismissed the maid. They moved out of their apartment and rented an
attic room.
She became used to heavy domestic work and all kinds of ghastly kitchen
chores. She washed dishes, wearing down her pink nails on the greasy pots
and saucepans. She washed the dirty sheets, shirts, and floorcloths by hand
and hung them up to dry on a line; each morning she took the rubbish down
to the street and carried the water up, pausing for breath on each landing.
And, dressed like any working-class woman, she shopped at the fruiterer’s,
the grocer’s, and the butcher’s, with a basket over her arm, haggling,
frequently abused and always counting every penny.
Each month they had to settle some accounts, renew others, and bargain for
time.
sous Coins of very small value.

Her husband worked in the evenings doing accounts for a shopkeeper and
quite frequently sat up into the early hours doing copying work at five sous a
page.
They lived like this for ten years.
By the time ten years had gone by, they had repaid everything, with not a
penny outstanding, in spite of the extortionate conditions and including the
accumulated interest.
Madame Loisel looked old now. She had turned into the battling, hard,
uncouth housewife who rules working-class homes. Her hair was untidy, her
skirts were askew, and her hands were red. She spoke in a gruff voice and
scrubbed floors on her hands and knees. But sometimes, when her husband
had gone to the office, she would sit by the window and think of that evening
long ago when she had been so beautiful and so admired.
What might not have happened had she not lost the necklace? Who could
tell? Who could possibly tell? Life is so strange, so fickle! How little is needed
to make or break us!

Champs-Elysées A famous street in Paris.

One Sunday, needing a break from her heavy working week, she went out
for a stroll on the Champs-Elysées. Suddenly she caught sight of a woman
pushing a child in a pram. It was Madame Forestier, still young, still
beautiful, and still attractive.
Madame Loisel felt apprehensive. Should she speak to her? Yes, why not?
Now that she had paid in full, she would tell her everything. Why not? She
went up to her.
‘Hello, Jeanne.’
The friend did not recognize her and was taken aback at being addressed
so familiarly by a common woman in the street. She stammered: ‘But… I’m
sorry… I don’t know… There’s some mistake.’
‘No mistake. I’m Madame Loisel.’
Her friend gave a cry: ‘But my poor Mathilde, how you’ve changed!’
‘Yes, I’ve been through some hard times since I saw you, very hard times.
And it was all on your account.’

‘On my account? Whatever do you mean?’
‘Do you remember that diamond necklace you lent me to go to the reception
at the Ministry?’
‘Yes. What about it?’
‘Well I lost it.’
‘Lost it? But you returned it to me.’
‘No, I returned another one just like it. And we’ve been paying for it these
past ten years. You know, it wasn’t easy for us. We had nothing… But it’s
over and done with now, and I’m glad.’
Madame Forestier stopped. ‘You mean you bought a diamond necklace to
replace mine?’
‘Yes. And you never noticed the difference, did you? They were exactly alike.’
And she smiled a proud, innocent smile.
Madame Forestier looked very upset and, taking both her hands in hers, said:
‘Oh, my poor Mathilde! But it was only an imitation necklace. It couldn’t
have been worth much more than five hundred francs!…’

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT

The story has a lot in common with the fairytale, Cinderella, but the outcome
is completely different. Everything hinges on the surprise ending, but the
effectiveness of this depends on the events which lead up to it and, in
particular, on the characters involved. Of these, Madame Loisel is the most
important and the most controversial. You will need to understand her
character well in order to answer examination questions.
In the first few sentences of the story, we learn that Madame Loisel is young
and attractive, and, whilst not rich, she is certainly not poor. Why then, is she
‘unhappy all the time’ (line 23)? Copy and complete the table, making a list
of the reasons you can find for her unhappiness, using the first section (up to
line 52).

KEY POINT

Maupassant’s moral world is not
simple. The reader is drawn into
making judgements but immediately
has them challenged by another point
of view.

TEXT ANTHOLOGY: FICTION

267

Most readers blame Madame Loisel for what happens, though some
sympathise with her. You need to decide what your own view is. Read through
the story and note all the occasions when you consider her to be a victim, and
all those when you think she is responsible for her own problems. Remember
to find a quotation to support each of your points.
Copy and complete the following table, balancing out the arguments for and
against and adding some points of your own. Find quotations to support each
of your own points. You will probably have more points in one column than the
other.

▼ MADAME LOISEL
▼ POINTS IN HER FAVOUR

▼ POINTS AGAINST HER

She deserves more than society offers her
– her birth is an ‘error of Fate.’

She is vain and frivolous – she had no fine
dresses and no jewellery, and that was all
she cared about.

Her husband is rather boring and too
‘careful with his money’.

She is ungrateful to a thoughtful husband.

Her suffering is not related to what
she did; it is unfair that she loses all
her beauty whereas Madame Forestier
remains ‘still young, still beautiful’.

She is the victim of her own pride; she
could have simply told her friend the truth
but did not want to lose face.

Her hard work at the end makes her
admirable – ‘quickly and heroically, she
resigned herself to what she could not
alter’.

Yes, she does make up for her mistake –
but this does not mean she did not deserve
what happened to her.

▶▶ Having considered all the evidence, what is your overall opinion of Madame
Loisel and how Maupassant has presented her?
The other characters are not so developed, although Monsieur Loisel is the
most important. Here are two candidates’ views of him. With which do you
agree and why?

STUDENT A

STUDENT B

Monsieur Loisel is a loving husband, who is presented
by the writer as both generous and indulgent. He goes
to great lengths to get the invitation to the occasion
and even sleeps in a separate room while his wife
enjoys the dancing. When faced with the problems
caused by the loss of the necklace, he works hard with
his wife to pay for the new necklace. He never criticises
her. He is her victim.

Monsieur Loisel is only a junior clerk without any
kind of ambition. He loves his wife but has no real
understanding of her or what her hopes must be; he is
out of his depth with her. At the end he is as stubbornly
proud as his wife and, instead of suggesting that she
simply tells the truth, he accepts their joint fate. They
are equally responsible for what happens.

Madame Forestier, Madame Loisel’s friend, is not written about in detail. While
she shows some kindness by loaning the necklace, she doesn’t tell Madame
Loisel that it is an imitation and is quite sharp when it is returned late. At the
end of the story, is she really sympathetic or is she mocking Madame Loisel?
Ironically, she is exactly the kind of woman that Madame Loisel, at the start of
the story, had hoped to be.

EXPLORING LANGUAGE

Because this is a translation, you are not commenting directly on the writer’s
use of language. However, some points about language can be made.
◼◼ Look for contrasts, such as that between the rich and sophisticated language
used to describe Madame Loisel’s dreams and her experiences at the party
(‘She danced ecstatically, wildly, intoxicated with pleasure…’) compared with
the blunter and more direct language used to emphasise the extent of her
poverty after the necklace is lost (‘Her hair was untidy … her hands were red’).
◼◼ Dialogue is used to illustrate character, such as the homeliness of her
husband: ‘Ah! Stew! Splendid! There’s nothing I like better…’. It is also used
to create drama. For example, look at the exchange between Madame
Loisel and Madame Forestier at the very end.
Find some more examples to illustrate these points.

‘SIGNIFICANT CIGARETTES’ (FROM THE ROAD HOME)
ROSE TREMAIN
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Rose Tremain is an established and very successful English
novelist who seeks out the strange, the unfamiliar and the
near‑unknowable as subjects for her fiction. ‘Significant
Cigarettes’ is an extract from her novel, The Road Home. It tells
the story of a journey of a desperately poor man called Lev. He
travels from Eastern Europe to London, where he hopes to make
a better life for himself. Before Lev left his own country, his wife
had died. In order to make the journey he has to leave his young
daughter behind.
The arrival in Britain of large numbers of migrants who want to
find work has caused concern and anger among some people. In
‘Significant Cigarettes’, Tremain shows us something of what it is
like to be poor, homeless and desperate.

▲ Novelist Rose Tremain has said that she aims
to attain a “new clarity” through her books for
both herself and her readers

BEFORE YOU START READING
1 What do you think might be difficult about welcoming strangers into
your homes?
2 How would you try to help a child who was suddenly left in your care
by a parent who was fleeing abroad? What considerations would be the

3 Have you ever explored or visited a place that was totally unfamiliar to
you? What did you find? What did you learn?

▼ ‘SIGNIFICANT CIGARETTES’ BY ROSE TREMAIN
On the coach, Lev chose a seat near the back and he sat huddled against the
window, staring out at the land he was leaving: at the fields of sunflowers
scorched by the dry wind, at the pig farms, at the quarries and rivers and at
the wild garlic growing green at the edge of the road.
Lev wore a leather jacket and jeans and a leather cap pulled low over his
eyes and his handsome face was grey-toned from his smoking and in his
hands he clutched an old red cotton handkerchief and a dented pack of
Russian cigarettes. He would soon be forty-three.
After some miles, as the sun came up, Lev took out a cigarette and stuck
it between his lips, and the woman sitting next to him, a plump, contained
person with moles like splashes of mud on her face, said quickly: ‘I’m sorry,
but there is no smoking allowed on this bus.’
Lev knew this, had known it in advance, had tried to prepare himself mentally
for the long agony of it. But even an unlit cigarette was a companion –
something to hold on to, something that had promise in it – and all he could

be bothered to do now was to nod, just to show the woman that he’d heard
what she’d said, reassure her that he wasn’t going to cause trouble; because
there they would have to sit for fifty hours or more, side by side with their
separate aches and dreams, like a married couple. They would hear each
other’s snores and sighs, smell the food and drink each had brought with them,
note the degree to which each was fearful or unafraid, make short forays
into conversation. And then later, when they finally arrived in London, they
would probably separate with barely a word or a look, walk out into a rainy
morning, each alone and beginning a new life. And Lev thought how all of this
was odd but necessary and already told him things about the world he was
travelling to, a world in which he would break his back working – if only that
work could be found. He would hold himself apart from other people, find
corners and shadows in which to sit and smoke, demonstrate that he didn’t
need to belong, that his heart remained in his own country.
There were two coach-drivers. These men would take turns to drive and to
sleep. There was an on-board lavatory, so the only stops the bus would make
would be for gas. At gas stations, the passengers would be able to clamber
off, walk a few paces, see wild flowers on a verge, soiled paper among
bushes, sun or rain on the road. They might stretch up their arms, put on
dark glasses against the onrush of nature’s light, look for a clover leaf, smoke
and stare at the cars rushing by. Then they would be herded back onto the
coach, resume their old attitudes, arm themselves for the next hundred miles,
for the stink of another industrial zone, or the sudden gleam of a lake, for
rain and sunset and the approach of darkness on silent marshes. There would
be times when the journey would seem to have no end.
Sleeping upright was not something Lev was practised in. The old seemed to
be able to do it, but forty-two was not yet old. Lev’s father, Stefan, sometimes
used to sleep upright, in summer, on a hard wooden chair in his lunch break
at the Baryn sawmill, with the hot sun falling onto the slices of sausage
wrapped in paper on his knee and onto his flask of tea. Both Stefan and Lev
could sleep lying down on a mound of hay or on the mossy carpet of a forest.
Often, Lev had slept on a rag rug beside his daughter’s bed, when she was
ill or afraid. And when his wife, Marina, was dying, he’d lain for five nights
on an area of linoleum flooring no wider than his outstretched arm, between
Marina’s hospital bed and a curtain patterned with pink and purple daisies,
and sleep had come and gone in a mystifying kind of way, painting strange
pictures in Lev’s brain that had never completely vanished.
Towards evening, after two stops for gas, the mole-flecked woman unwrapped
a hard-boiled egg. She peeled it silently. The smell of the egg reminded Lev
of the sulphur springs at Jor, where he’d taken Marina, just in case nature
could cure what man had given up for lost. Marina had immersed her body
obediently in the scummy water, lain there looking at a female stork returning
to its high nest, and said to Lev: ‘If only we were storks.’
‘Why d’you say that?’ Lev had asked.
‘Because you never see a stork dying. It’s as though they didn’t die.’
If only we were storks.
On the woman’s knee a clean cotton napkin was spread and her white hands
smoothed it and she unwrapped rye bread and a twist of salt.
‘My name is Lev,’ said Lev.

‘My name is Lydia,’ said the woman. And they shook hands, Lev’s hand
holding the scrunched-up kerchief, and Lydia’s hand rough with salt and
smelling of egg, and then Lev asked: ‘What are you planning to do in England?’
and Lydia said: ‘I have some interviews in London for jobs as a translator.’
‘That sounds promising.’
‘I hope so. I was a teacher of English at School 237 in Yarbl, so my language
is very colloquial.’
Lev looked at Lydia. It wasn’t difficult to imagine her standing in front of
a class and writing words on a blackboard. He said: ‘I wonder why you’re
leaving our country when you had a good job at School 237 in Yarbl?’
‘Well,’ said Lydia. ‘I became very tired of the view from my window. Every
day, summer and winter, I looked out at the school yard and the high fence
and the apartment block beyond, and I began to imagine I would die seeing
these things, and I didn’t want this. I expect you understand what I mean?’
Lev took off his leather cap and ran his fingers through his thick grey hair.
He saw Lydia turn to him for a moment and look very seriously into his eyes.
He said: ‘Yes, I understand.’
Then there was a silence, while Lydia ate her hard-boiled egg. She chewed
very quietly. When she’d finished the egg, Lev said: ‘My English isn’t too
bad. I took some classes in Baryn, but my teacher told me my pronunciation
wasn’t very good. May I say some words and you can tell me if I’m
pronouncing them correctly?’
‘Yes, of course,’ said Lydia.
Lev said: ‘Lovely. Sorry. I am legal. How much please. Thank you. May you
help me.’
‘May I help you,’ corrected Lydia. ‘May I help you,’ repeated Lev.
‘Go on,’ said Lydia.
‘Stork,’ said Lev. ‘Stork’s nest. Rain. I am lost. I wish for an interpreter. Beeand-bee.’
‘Be-and-be?’ said Lydia. ‘No, no. You mean “to be, or not to be”.
‘No,’ said Lev. ‘Bee-and-bee. Family hotel, quite cheap.’
‘Oh, yes, I know. B & B.’
Lev could now see that darkness was falling outside the window and he
thought how, in his village, darkness had always arrived in precisely the same
way, from the same direction, above the same trees, whether early or late,
whether in summer, winter or spring, for the whole of his life. This darkness
– particular to that place, Auror – was how, in Lev’s heart, darkness would
always fall. And so he told Lydia that he came from Auror, had worked in the
Baryn sawmill until it closed two years ago, and since then he’d found no work
at all and his family – his mother, his five-year-old daughter and he – had lived
off the money his mother made selling jewellery manufactured from tin.
‘Oh,’ said Lydia. ‘I think that’s very resourceful, to make jewellery from tin.’
‘Sure,’ said Lev. ‘But it isn’t enough.’

Tucked into his boot was a small flask of vodka. He extracted the flask and
took a long swig. Lydia kept eating her rye bread. Lev wiped his mouth with
the red handkerchief and saw his face reflected in the coach window. He
looked away. Since the death of Marina, he didn’t like to catch sight of his
own reflection, because what he always saw in it was his own guilt at still
being alive.
‘Why did the sawmill at Baryn close?’ asked Lydia.
‘They ran out of trees,’ said Lev.
‘Very bad,’ said Lydia. ‘What other work can you do?’
Lev drank again. Someone had told him that in England vodka was too
expensive to drink.
Immigrants made their own alcohol from potatoes and tap water, and when
Lev thought about these industrious immigrants, he imagined them sitting by
a coal fire in a tall house, talking and laughing, with rain falling outside the
window and red buses going past and a television flickering in a corner of
the room. He sighed and said: ‘I will do any work at all. My daughter Maya
needs clothes, shoes, books, toys, everything. England is my hope.’
Towards ten o’clock, red blankets were given out to the coach passengers,
some of whom were already sleeping. Lydia put away the remnants of her
meal, covered her body with the blanket and switched on a fierce little light
above her under the baggage rack and began reading a faded old paperback,
printed in English. Lev saw that the title of her book was The Power and the
Glory. His longing for a cigarette had grown steadily since he’d drunk the
vodka and now it was acute. He could feel the yearning in his lungs and in
his blood, and his hands grew fidgety and he felt a tremor in his legs. How
long before the next gas stop? It could be four or five hours. Everyone on
the bus would be asleep by then, except him and one of the two drivers.
Only they would keep a lonely, exhausting vigil, the driver’s body tensed to
the moods and alarms of the dark, unravelling road; his own aching for the
comfort of nicotine or oblivion – and getting neither.
He envied Lydia, immersed in her English book. Lev knew he had to distract
himself with something…. In desperation, he took from his wallet a brand
new British twenty-pound note and reached up and switched on his own
little reading light and began to examine the note. On one side, the frumpy
Queen, E II R, with her diadem, her face grey on a purple ground, and on the
other, a man, some personage from the past, with a dark drooping moustache
and an angel blowing a trumpet above him and all the angel’s radiance
falling on him in vertical lines. ‘The British venerate their history,’ Lev had
been told in his English class, ‘chiefly because they have never been subjected
to Occupation. Only intermittently do they see that some of their past deeds
were not good.’
The indicated lifespan of the man on the note was 1857–1934. He looked
like a banker, but what had he done to be on a twenty-pound note in the
twenty-first century? Lev stared at his determined jaw, squinted at his name
written out in a scrawl beneath the wing collar, but couldn’t read it. He
thought that this was a person who would never have known any other
system of being alive but Capitalism. He would have heard the names Hitler
and Stalin, but not been afraid – would have had no need to be afraid of
anything except a little loss of capital in what Americans called the Crash,

when men in New York had jumped out of windows and off roofs. He would
have died safely in his bed before London was bombed to ruins, before
Europe was torn apart. Right to the end of his days, the angel’s radiance
had probably shone on this man’s brow and on his fusty clothes, because it
was known across the world: the English were lucky. Well, thought Lev, I’m

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT

KEY POINT

It is important to realise that this is a
scene from the early part of a novel,
not a text designed to stand alone.

‘Significant Cigarettes’ is an extract from a novel. This means that we should
not simply read it as an account of events but as a piece of writing designed
to draw us in to the novel’s characters and themes. In this piece we learn
about Lev and Lydia and the things that concern them, themes which may be
important in the novel from which this extract is taken.
The author provides a contrast between two characters who are travelling side
by side, for some days, on a bus. We are told about their lives back home
and their reasons for travelling, and we are provided with an insight into their
expectations of life when they arrive in London. This information encourages
us to imagine how they will cope at their journey’s end.
Copy and complete the following table, identifying as many themes from the
passage as you can and add examples of each from the text.

▼ EXAMPLE FROM THE TEXT

Departure and leaving things behind

‘huddled against the window, staring out
at the land he was leaving’

EXPLORING LANGUAGE

The writer arranges the text to help us explore important aspects of the
story. Events on the journey lead us through Lev’s thoughts, providing an
apparently natural opportunity to hear about the life he has left behind and
what he imagines life will be like once he reaches London. When he sees that
it is getting dark outside, he is reminded of the way in which night falls in his
village, and these memories give the reader an insight into Lev’s background.
There is a contrast too between the confident speech of Lydia and Lev’s
requests for help with the English language.
The words and phrases used by a writer affect the way in which we see and
understand things. For example, Lydia speaks first: ‘I’m sorry, but there is no
smoking allowed on this bus.’ She apologises for speaking to him – ‘I’m sorry’
– then adds words which suggest that she feels that she should point out the
ban on smoking. This is different from, ‘No smoking on the bus,’ or, ‘Don’t
think you’re going to smoke next to me.’ Later, Lev’s craving for a cigarette
grows and a number of the symptoms are shown in striking words and phrases
(‘his hands grew fidgety’), and a succession of sentences ending with a much
longer sentence that reflect his growing urge to smoke. The cigarettes provide

‘WHISTLE AND I’LL COME TO YOU’ (FROM THE
WOMAN IN BLACK) SUSAN HILL

▲ English writer Susan Hill

GENERAL VOCABULARY

Booker Prize prestigious British award
given for outstanding literary works in
English
London’s West End an area of London
where a number of good quality
professional theatres are located

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Susan Hill is an English writer of literary novels, ghost stories,
children’s books, detective novels and memoirs. She has won the
Whitbread, Somerset Maugham and John Llewellyn Rhys awards
and has been shortlisted for the Booker Prize. She is known for
writing in the Gothic style with its distinctive creation of suspense
through a description of background and atmosphere.
The Woman in Black is probably the most well-known of her
ghost stories written in this tradition and its stage production is
the second longest running play in London’s West End.
The novel is the story of Arthur Kipps and is narrated in the first
person.
It recounts his experiences in the town of Crythin Gifford when he
was a young junior solicitor. The story centres around Eel Marsh
House, where unexplained noises are heard and the ghostly
figure of the Woman in Black is sighted. Kipps later learns that
this is the ghost of Jennet Humfrye, a woman whose son died in
an accident on the marshes, and that her appearance foretells
the death of a child. Kipps’s involvement in events at Eel Marsh
House ultimately lead to the deaths of his wife and child.

BEFORE YOU START READING
1 Read about the Gothic novel and find out about some of its more
famous examples, such as Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto and
Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho.
2 There are several movie adaptations of The Woman in Black. Try to
watch one as a class, paying particular attention to the way in which the
story’s background is shown and how an atmosphere of eeriness and
suspense is created.
3 Do you believe in ghosts and the supernatural? Talk about some of the
ghost stories you know from the folklore of your country and culture.
What are their common features? Are they similar or different to the
typical stories of the Gothic tradition?

open marsh. Windows were rattling everywhere and there was the sound of
moaning down all the chimneys of the house and whistling through every
nook and cranny.
At first I was alarmed. Then, as I lay still, gathering my wits, I reflected on
how long Eel Marsh House had stood here, steady as a lighthouse, quite
alone and exposed, bearing the brunt of winter after winter of gales and
driving rain and sleet and spray. It was unlikely to blow away tonight. And
then, those memories of childhood began to be stirred again and I dwelt
nostalgically upon all those nights when I had lain in the warm and snug
safety of my bed in the nursery at the top of our family house in Sussex,
hearing the wind rage round like a lion, howling at the doors and beating
upon the windows but powerless to reach me. I lay back and slipped into
that pleasant, trance-like state somewhere between sleeping and waking,
recalling the past and all its emotions and impressions vividly, until I felt I
was a small boy again.
Then from somewhere, out of that howling darkness, a cry came to my ears,
catapulting me back into the present and banishing all tranquility.
I listened hard. Nothing. The tumult of the wind, like a banshee, and the
banging and rattling of the window in its old, ill-fitting frame. Then yes,
again, a cry, that familiar cry of desperation and anguish, a cry for help from
a child somewhere out on the marsh.
There was no child. I knew that. How could there be? Yet how could I lie
here and ignore even the crying of some long dead ghost?
‘Rest in peace,’ I thought, but this poor one did not, could not.
After a few moments I got up. I would go down into the kitchen and make
myself a drink, stir up the fire a little and sit beside it trying, trying to shut
out that calling voice for which I could do nothing, and no one had been able
to do anything for… how many years?

As I went out onto the landing, Spider the dog following me at once, two

that very second before gone past me on their way from the top of the stairs
to one of the other rooms, and, as a tremendous blast of wind hit the house
so that it all but seemed to rock at the impact, the lights went out. I had not
bothered to pick up my torch from the bedside table and now I stood in the
pitch blackness, unsure for a moment of my bearings.
And the person who had gone by, and who was now in this house with me?
I had seen no one, felt nothing. There had been no movement, no brush of
a sleeve against mine, no disturbance of the air, I had not even heard a foot
step. I had simply the absolutely certain sense of someone just having passed
close to me and gone away down the corridor. Down the short narrow
corridor that led to the nursery whose door had been so firmly locked and
then, inexplicably, opened.
For a moment, I actually began to conjecture that there was indeed someone
– another human being – living here in this house, a person who hid
themselves away in that mysterious nursery and came out at night to fetch
food and drink and to take the air. Perhaps it was the woman in black?

rational explanation for the presence I had been so aware of. But then they
ceased. There was no living occupant of Eel Marsh House other than myself
and Samuel Daily’s dog. Whatever was about, whoever I had seen, and heard
rocking, and who had passed me by just now, whoever had opened the
locked door was not ‘real’. No. But what was ‘real’? At that moment I began
to doubt my own reality.
The first thing I must have was a light and I groped my way back across to
my bed, reached over it and got my hand to the torch at last, took a step
back, stumbled over the dog who was at my heels and dropped the torch.
It went spinning away across the floor and fell somewhere by the window
with a crash and the faint sound of breaking glass. I cursed but managed
by crawling about on my hands and knees, to find it again and to press the
switch. No light came on. The torch had broken.
For a moment I was as near to weeping tears of despair and fear, frustration
and tension, as I had ever been since my childhood. But instead of crying I
drummed my fists upon the floorboards, in a burst of violent rage, until they
throbbed.
It was Spider who brought me to my sense by scratching a little at my
arm and then by licking the hand I stretched out to her. We sat on the
floor together and I hugged her warm body to me, glad of her, thoroughly
ashamed of myself, calmer and relieved, while the wind boomed and roared
without, and again and again I heard that child’s terrible cry borne on the
gusts towards me.

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT

KEY POINT

Think about these themes in the
passage and any others you can draw
out. Analyse how they work together to
create the atmosphere.

‘Whistle and I’ll Come to You’ is the title of the tenth chapter of The Woman
in Black. This extract describes a night at Eel Marsh House and the ghostly
happenings that worried the narrator. The text communicates the thoughts and
feelings of the narrator as they shift from contemplating the harsh weather and
reminiscing over his childhood, to extreme fear as he hears the wailing of the
child and begins to strongly feel the presence of some being in the house.
The atmosphere of the house is effectively conveyed not only through the vivid
description, but also from the way that Arthur Kipps is ready to believe that
there may even be a person hiding there. The willingness of the narrator to
believe in the supernatural creates a similar reaction in the reader making the
extract all the more powerful and evocative.
Some of the themes in this extract are:
◼◼ isolation
◼◼ the supernatural
◼◼ fear
◼◼ a sense of the past.

Isolation

‘…quite alone and

The house itself is isolated. The word
‘exposed’ creates a sense of vulnerability
that is enhanced by the fact that the
house has had to survive the harsh
elements. Ironically the narrator is trying
to convince himself that the house is as
‘steady as a lighthouse’.

KEY POINT

An understanding of English grammar
will better enable you to understand
what the writer is trying to achieve.

Sometimes, writers use participle phrases as a technique. These can be
present participle phrases (beginning with verbs ending in ‘-ing’, such as
‘running’, ‘thinking’ and so on) or past participle phrases (beginning with verbs
that have ‘-ed’ endings, such as ‘presented’, ‘created’ or irregular ones such
as ‘driven’).
In the sentence beginning, ‘I lay back and slipped into that pleasant, trancelike state…’, recalling the past is an action that happens while the narrator is
lying back in bed. This participle phrase enables the reader to understand why
the narrator felt like he was a child again.
In the same way, the sentence beginning, ‘We sat on the floor together and I
hugged her warm body to me…’ shows the reader the narrator’s mental state.
His physical action of hugging the dog makes the reader think of relief; it is the
past participle phrase ‘ashamed of myself’ that indicates there is a sense of
shame as well.
The technique is often used to give more information about happenings. This
adds detail to a text and gives variety to sentence structure as well.

CRITICAL THINKING

▼ STRUCTURE AS A TECHNIQUE
Structure is an effective technique in all types of writing and can be used
to create tension and suspense in ghost stories. In this extract, suspense
is built throughout to reach a climax, where the narrator drums his fists
against the floor, and then to a sense of resolution, where he calms down.
Copy and complete the following table, listing the events and
commenting on how each adds to the build-up of suspense.

▼ EVENTS

▼ COMMENT

Reads a book and then goes to sleep

Creates a sense of the ordinary, even though
the weather is harsh. The sense of inner calm
suggested here makes the change that occurs
later more effective by contrast.

‘Urban legends’ are modern day folklore that consist of largely fictional
stories that have supernatural and/or frightening elements.
1 Discuss why it is important to be able to distinguish between fact and
fiction in the many stories we hear and read every day. Try to include
examples of hoaxes with which you are familiar. For example, you may
have heard of the Loch Ness Monster, a creature said to live in a lake
in the Scottish Highlands. Someone claimed to have photographed the
Monster in 1934, but the photograph was proved a hoax in the 1990s.

▼ INFLUENCE OF CHILDHOOD
KEY POINT

Our early childhood experiences
inevitably have an influence on our
outlook and so will influence your own
writing.

Read the extract below, in which Susan Hill describes the influence that
her birthplace and childhood have had on her writing.
‘I was born beside the North Sea, in Scarborough, Yorkshire one
bitterly cold winter during WWII, when the snow was deep and the
waves were crashing onto the cliffs not far away.
How much do we carry with us of our birth – the when and the where?
I certainly carry with me all the stories I was told about that day, that
winter. But Scarborough, where I lived and rarely left until I was 16, is not
the mere background but the whole setting of all my childhood memories.
So many of my novels and short stories feature it, though always in
disguise – feature the sea, and seaside places. Growing up in an unusual
place gives a writer a big advantage because the imagination is stimulated
and intrigued by everything in and about it from the beginning.’
Write a blog entry about a childhood experience or place that is very
memorable or which has had a strong influence on you.
Write a short story entitled ‘The Deepest Shadow’.
Ann Radcliffe’s novel, The Italian, is the story of a nobleman called Vivaldi and
his attempt to marry Elena, a beautiful orphan. With many obstacles to the
proposed marriage, Vivaldi has to contend with mysterious monks, ghostly
figures and the Holy Inquisition. The following extract shows the way in which
Radcliffe creates the eerie atmosphere of a chamber in a ruined fortress where
Vivaldi and his servant Paulo are trapped for the night.

FROM THE ITALIAN (1797) BY ANN RADCLIFFE
Vivaldi again examined the walls, and as unsuccessfully as before; but in
one corner of the vault lay an object, which seemed to tell the fate of one
who had been confined here, and to hint his own: it was a garment covered
with blood. Vivaldi and his servant discovered it at the same instant; and
a dreadful foreboding of their own destiny fixed them, for some moments,
to the spot. Vivaldi first recovered himself, when instead of yielding to
despondency, all his faculties were aroused to devise some means for
escaping; but Paulo’s hopes seemed buried beneath the dreadful vestments
upon which he still gazed. ‘Ah, my Signor!’ said he, at length, in a faltering
accent, ‘who shall dare to raise that garment? What if it should conceal the
mangled body whose blood has stained it!’

Vivaldi, shudderingly, turned to look on it again.
‘It moves!’ exclaimed Paulo; ‘I see it move!’ as he said which, he started to the
opposite side of the chamber. Vivaldi stepped a few paces back, and as quickly
returned; when, determined to know the event at once, he raised the garment
upon the point of his sword, and perceived, beneath, other remains of dress,
heaped high together, while even the floor below was stained with gore.
Below is a student’s answer to the question: ‘How is suspense created in the
extract from The Italian?’

The extract from The Italian creates suspense through a range of techniques.
First and foremost, it tells us that the character was looking for a way out
‘unsuccessfully’. So we know he must be sort of really scared because he can’t find
a way out. Then the writer gets us to focus on something really frightening – a bloody
garment. This really brings suspense because now we are thinking, what can this be.
Also the word ‘bloody’ gives a good visual image and creates danger and suspense.

NIGHT
ALICE MUNRO
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Alice Munro is a Canadian writer and Nobel Prize winner. She is
best known for the changes that she introduced to the modern
short story, particularly the way in which she moves the narrative
between the past and the present. She has published several
collections of short stories, including Dance of the Happy Shades
(1968) and Open Secrets (1994).
Her stories are often set in Huron County, Ontario, where she was
born in 1931. Night appeared in the collection Dear Life, published
in 2012 as the second of four stories in the section titled ‘Finale’.
Munro herself called these ‘not quite stories’ in view of the fact that
they are autobiographical writings with fictional elements.

sugaring Boiling down of maple sap until it
thickens into syrup or crystallises into sugar.

When I was young, there seemed to be never childbirth, or burst appendix
or any other drastic physical event that did not occur simultaneously with a
snowstorm. The roads would be closed, there was no question of digging out
a car anyway, and some horses had to be hitched up to make their way into
town to the hospital. It was just lucky that there were horses still around – in
the normal course of events they would have been given up, but the war and
gas rationing had changed all that, at least for the time being.
When the pain in my side struck, therefore it had to do so at about eleven
o’clock at night, and a blizzard had to be blowing, and since we were not
stabling any horses at the moment, the neighbours’ team had to be brought
into action to take me to the hospital. A trip of no more than a mile and a
half but an adventure all the same. The doctor was waiting, and to nobody’s
surprise he prepared to take out my appendix. …
So I lay, minus my appendix, for some days looking out a hospital window at
the snow sifting in a sombre way through some evergreens. I don’t suppose
it ever crossed my head to wonder how my father was going to pay for this
distinction. (I think he sold a woodlot that he had kept when he disposed of
his father’s farm. He would have hoped to use it for trapping or sugaring. Or
perhaps he felt an unmentionable nostalgia.)

Then I went back to school, and enjoyed being excused from physical
training for longer than necessary, and one Saturday morning when my
mother and I were alone in the kitchen she told me that my appendix had
been taken out in the hospital, just as I thought, but it was not the only thing
removed. The doctor had seen fit to take it out while he was at it, but the
main thing that concerned him was a growth. A growth, my mother said, the
size of a turkey’s egg.
But don’t worry, she said, it’s all over now.
The thought of cancer had never entered my head and she never mentioned
it. I don’t think there could be such a revelation today without some kind of
question, some probing about whether it was or it wasn’t. Cancerous or benign
– we would want to know at once. The only way I can explain our failure to
speak of it was that there must have been a cloud around that word…
So I did not ask and wasn’t told and can only suppose it was benign or was
most skillfully got rid of, for here I am today. And so little do I think that all
throughout my life when called upon to list my surgeries, I automatically say
or write only ‘Appendix.’…
In the heat of early June I got out of school, having made good enough marks
to free me from the final examination. I looked well, I did chores around the
house, I read books as usual, nobody knew there was a thing the matter with
me.
Now I have to describe the sleeping arrangements in the bedroom occupied
by my sister and myself. It was a small room that could not accommodate
two single beds side by side, so the solution was a pair of bunk beds with a
ladder in place to help with whoever slept in the top bunk to climb into bed.
That was me. When I had been younger and prone to teasing, I would lift up
the corner of my thin mattress and threaten to spit on my little sister lying
helpless in the bunk below. Of course my sister – her name was Catherine –
was not really helpless. She could hide under her covers, but my game as to
watch until suffocation or curiosity drove her out, and at that moment to spit
or successfully pretend to spit on her bared face, enraging her.
asinine Very stupid.

invalid A person who is weak due to illness
or some injury.

I was too old for such fooling, certainly too old by this time. My sister was
nine when I was fourteen. The relationship between us was always unsettled.
When I wasn’t tormenting her, teasing her in some asinine way, I would take
on the role of sophisticated counsellor or hair-raising story teller… I don’t
mean to say that I was entirely in control of her, or even that our lives were
constantly intertwined. She had her own friends, her own games. …
In the month June, as I have said, I was free of school and left on my own
as I don’t remember being in quite the same way in the other time of my
growing up. I did some chores in the house, but my mother must have been
well enough, as yet, to handle most of that work. Or perhaps we had just
enough money at the time to hire what she – my mother – would call a
maid, though everyone else said hired girl. I don’t remember, at any rate,
having to tackle any of the jobs that piled up for me in later summers, when
I fought quite willingly to maintain the decency of our house. It seems that
the mysterious turkey egg must have given me some invalid status, so that I
could spend part of the time wandering about like a visitor.
Though not trailing any special clouds. Nobody in our family would have got
away with that. It was all inward – this uselessness and strangeness I felt. …

It must have been just that every moment of the day was not filled up with
jobs, as it was summers before after.
So maybe that was the reason that I had begun to have trouble getting to
sleep. At first, I think, that meant lying wide awake I was, with the rest of the
household asleep. I would have read, and got tired the usual way, and turned
out my light and waited. Nobody would have called out to me earlier, telling
me to put out my light and get to sleep. For the first time ever (and this too
must have marked a special status) I was left to make up my own mind about
such a thing.
It took a while for the house to change from the light of day and from the
household lights turned on late into the evening. Leaving behind the general
clatter of things to be done, hung up, finished with, it became a stranger place
in which people and the work that dictated their lives fell away, their uses for
everything around them fell away, all the furniture retreated into itself and no
longer existed because of nobody’s attention.
You might think this was liberation. At first, perhaps it was. The freedom.
The strangeness. But as my failure to fall asleep prolonged itself, and as
it finally took hold all together until it changed into the dawn, I became
more and more disturbed by it. I started saying rhymes, then real poetry,
first to make myself go under but then hardly of my own volition. The
activity seemed to mock me. I was mocking myself, as the words turned into
absurdity, into the silliest random speech.
I was not myself.
I had been hearing that said of people now and then, all my life, without
thinking what it could mean.
So who do you think you are, then?
I had been hearing that too, without attaching to it any real menace, just
taking it as a sort of routine jeering.
Think again.
By this time it wasn’t sleep I was after. I knew mere sleep wasn’t likely.
Maybe not even desirable. Something was taking hold of me and it was my
business, my hope to fight it off. I had the sense to do that, but only barely, as
it seemed. Whatever it was was trying to tell me to do things, not exactly for
any reason but just to see if such acts were possible. It was informing me that
motives were not necessary.
It was only necessary to give in. How strange. Not out of revenge or for any
normal reason, but just because you had thought of something.
And I did think of it. The more I chased the thought away, the more it
came back. No vengeance, no hatred – as I have said, no reason, except
something like an utterly cold deep thought that was an urging, more of a
contemplation, could take possession of me. I must not even think of it but I
did think of it.
The thought was there and hanging in my mind.
The thought that I could strangle my little sister, who was asleep in the bank
below me and whom I loved more than anybody in the world.

which could be lying right beside me there that night. Not a savage madness
either, but something that could be almost teasing. A lazy, teasing, halfsluggish suggestion that seemed to have been waiting a long time.
It might be saying why not. Why not try the worst?
The worst. Here in the most familiar place, the room where we had lain for
all our lives and thought ourselves most safe. I might do it for no reason I or
anybody could understand, except that I could not help it.
The thing to do was to get myself out of that room and out of that house. I
went down the rungs of the ladder and never cast a single look at my sister
where she slept. Then quietly down the stairs, nobody stirring, into the
kitchen where everything was so familiar to that that I could not my way
without a light. The kitchen door was not really locked – I am not even sure
that we possessed a key. A chair was pushed under the door knob so that
anyone trying to get in would make a great clatter. A slow careful removal of
the chair could be managed without making any noise at all.
After the first night I was able to make my moves without a break, so that I
could be outside, as it seemed, within a couple of smooth seconds.
Of course there were no streetlights – we were too far from town.
Everything was larger. The trees around the house were always called by their
names – the beech tree, the elm tree, the oak tree, the maples always spoken
of in the plural and not differentiated, because they clung together. Now
they were all intensely black. So were the white lilac tree (no longer with
its blooms) and the purple lilac tree – always called lilac trees not bushes
because they had grown too big.
The front and backside lawns were easy to negotiate because I had mown
them myself with the idea of giving is some town like respectability. …
▲ Alice Munro was inspired by her native Huron
County, Ontario, Canada

Back and forth I walked, first close to the house and then venturing here and
there as I got to rely on my eyesight and could count on not bumping into
the pump handle or the platform that supported the clothesline. The birds
began to stir, and then sing – as if each of them had thought of it separately,
up there in the trees. They woke far earlier than I would have thought
possible. But soon after those earliest starting songs, there got to be a little
whitening in the sky. And suddenly I would be overwhelmed with sleepiness.
I went back into the house, where there was suddenly darkness everywhere,
and I very properly, carefully, silently, set the tilted chair back under the
knob, and went upstairs without a sound, managing doors and steps with the
caution necessary, although I seemed already half asleep. I fell into my pillow,
and I woke late – late in our house being around eight o’clock.
I would remember everything then, but it was so absurd – the bad part of it
indeed was so absurd – that I could get rid of it fairly easily. My brother and
sister had gone off to their classes in the public school, but their dishes were
still on the table, a few bits of puffed rice floating in the excess milk.

my night difficulties, nobody came up with the simple information that I’d be
better of getting more action during the day.
My troubles returned with the night of course. The demons got hold of me
again. I knew enough soon to get up and out of my bunk without pretending
that things would get better and that I would in fact go to sleep if I tried hard
enough. I made my way as carefully out of the house as I had done before. I
became able to find my way around more easily; even the inside of the rooms
became more visible to me and yet more strange. …
The east wall of the kitchen had no windows in it but it had a door opening
on a stoop where we stood to hang out the heavy wet washing, and haul it in
when it was dry and smelling all fresh and congratulatory, from white sheets
to dark heavy overalls.
At that stoop, I sometimes halted in my night walks. I never sat down but it
eased me to look toward the town, maybe just to inhale the sanity of it. All
the people getting up before long, having their shops to go to, their doors to
unlock and milk bottles to take inside, their busyness.
One night – I can’t say whether it could be the twentieth or the twelfth or
only the eighth or the ninth that I had got up and walked – I got a sense, too
late for me to change my pace, that there was somebody around the corner.
There was somebody waiting there and I could do nothing but walk right on.
I would be caught if I turned back, and it would be worse that way than to
be confronted.
Who was it? Nobody but my father. He too sitting on the stoop looking
towards town and that improbable faint light. He was dressed in his day
clothes – dark work pants, the next thing to overalls but not quite, and dark,
rough shirt and boots. He was smoking a cigarette. One he rolled himself of
course. Maybe the cigarette smoke alerted me to another presence, though
it’s possible that in those days the smell of tobacco smoke was everywhere,
inside buildings and out, so there was no way to notice it.
He said good morning, in what might have seemed a natural way except that
there was nothing natural about it. We weren’t accustomed to giving such
greeting in our family. There was nothing hostile about this – it was just thought
unnecessary, I suppose, when we would see each other off and on all day.
I said good morning back. And it must have been getting towards morning
or my father would not have been dressed for a day’s work in that way. The
sky may have been whitening but hidden still between the heavy trees. The
birds singing, too. I had taken to staying away from my bunk bedstill later
and later, even though I didn’t get comfort from doing so as I had at first. The
possibilities that had once inhabited only the bedroom, the bunk bed till later
and later, even though I didn’t get comfort from doing so as I had at first. The
possibilities that had once inhabited only the bedroom, the bunk beds, were
taking up the corners everywhere.
Now that I come to think of it, why wasn’t my father in his overalls? He was
dressed as if he had to go into town for something, first thing in the morning.
I could not continue walking; the whole rhythm of it had been broken.
‘Having trouble sleeping?’ he said.
My impulse was to say no, but then I thought of the difficulties of explaining
that I was just walking around, so I said yes.
He said that was often the case on summer nights.

intimation Indication or hint.

I am not sure what conversation he meant to follow then, as regards of my
being awake. He seems to have declared wakefulness to be a nuisance, but
was that to be all? I certainly did not intend to tell him more. If he had given
the slightest intimation that he knew there was more, if he’d even hinted that
he had come here intending to hear it, I don’t think he’d have got anything
out of me at all. I had to break the silence out of my own will, saying that I
could not sleep. I had to get out of bed and walk.
Why was that?
I did not know.
Not bad dreams?
No.
‘Stupid question,’ he said. You wouldn’t get chased out of your bed on
account of good dreams.
He let me wait to go on, he didn’t ask anything. I meant to back off but I
kept talking. The truth was told with only the slightest modification.
When I spoke of my little sister I said that I was afraid I would hurt her. I
believed that would be enough, that he would know enough of what I meant.
‘Strangle her,’ I said then. I could not stop myself after all.
Now I could not unsay it, I could not go back to the person I had been
before.
My father had heard of it. He had heard that I thought myself capable – of,
for no reason, strangling little Catherine in her sleep.
He said, ‘Well.’
Then he said not to worry. He said, ‘People have those kinds of thoughts
sometimes.’
He said this quite seriously and without any sort of alarm or jumpy surprise.
People have these kinds of thoughts or fears if you like, but there’s no real
worry about it, no more than a dream, you could say.

He did not blame me, though, for thinking if it. Did not wonder at me, was
what he said.
There were other things he could have said. He could have questioned me
further about my attitude to my little sister or my dissatisfactions with
my life in general. If this were happening today, he might have made an
appointment for me to see a psychiatrist. (I think that is what I might have
done for a child, a generation and an income further on.)
The fact is that what he did worked as well. It set me down, but without
either mockery or alarm, in the world we were living in.

If you live long enough as a parent nowadays, you discover that you have
made mistakes you didn’t bother to know about along with the ones you do
know about all too well. You are somewhat humbled at heart, sometimes
disgusted with yourself. I don’t think my father felt anything like this. I do
know that if I had ever taxed him, with his use on me of the razor strap or
his belt, he might have said something about liking or lumping it. Those
strappings, then, would have stayed in his mind, if they stayed at all, as no
more than necessary and adequate curbing of a mouthy child’s imagining
that she should rule the roost.
‘You thought you were too smart,’ was what he might have given as his
reason for punishments, and indeed you heard often in those times, with
the smartness figuring as an obnoxious imp that had to have the sass beaten
out of him. Otherwise there was the risk of him growing up thinking he was
smart. Or her, as the case might be.
However, on that breaking morning he gave me just what I needed to hear
and what I was even to forget about soon enough.

UNDERSTANDING THE TEXT
KEY POINT

‘Night’ blends elements of the
autobiography and short story genres.
It narrates events but the present
reflection on those events.

I have thought that he was maybe in his better work clothes because he had
a morning appointment to go to the bank, to learn, not to his surprise, that
there was no extension to his loan. He had worked as hard as he could but
the market was not going to turn around and he had to find a new way of
supporting us as paying off what we owed at the same time. Or he may have
found out that there was a name for my mother’s shakiness and that it was
not going to stop. Or that he was in love with an impossible woman.
Never mind. From then on I could sleep.

According to the writer, Night is part of a ‘separate unit, one that is
autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, entirely so in fact’. This
means that, though it is a short story, it is not the same as others in the genre.
It borrows heavily from the writer’s own childhood experiences. The story,
narrated from an adult’s point of view, in the first person, is both a narration of
events unfolding and a present reflection on those past events.
‘Night’ shows us the interior world of the narrator. Her thoughts about her
illness and its effects, her conflicted feelings about her sister and general
reflections about her family and background, are all a part of the narrative.
At the same time, the reader is shown a glimpse of life in rural Canada in the
1950s and gains an understanding of the family relationships that have a
significant impact on the narrator.

This shows that she was allowed to be
freer than she would have otherwise
been, because of her illness. It hints at the
idleness that would have contributed to
the narrator’s sense of unease.

The autobiographical and fictional elements of this short story are very cleverly
intertwined, so it is difficult for the reader to judge where the autobiography
ends and the storytelling begins. This is partly what makes the story both
entertaining and effective. However, there are certain sections where the
reader feels that one aspect is stronger than the other.
Two such extracts are given in the following table. Complete the table by adding

NARRATIVE AND SPEECH

KEY POINT

A writer will have reasons for deciding
to use either direct or indirect speech.
What difference do you think it makes?

In fictional narratives, speech is used to convey character, break up the
narration and move the plot forward. Speech in narratives can come in many
forms. Usually, dialogue is written as direct or indirect speech.
In direct speech we write the words as they were spoken between quotation
marks. For example:
‘I felt very weak after the surgery,’ Elena said.
In indirect speech, what was said is reported by the narrative voice. For
example:
‘Elena said that she felt weak after the surgery’.

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

OVERVIEW OF IMAGINATIVE WRITING
You can source ideas from stories you have already heard or read,
or from events about which you know something. You may know
or imagine a character to use in your story, whose actions and
feelings you can convey to your reader.

▶

The plot consists of the main events of a story. You can develop a plot by
listing the events that you think will take place in your story. These events, and
the order in which they occur, may well change as you write and develop your
characters and setting.

▼ WORKING ON A PLOT
Working in small groups, choose a story that you all know or that you
have studied in school. Work together to list the main narrative points of
the story.

STRUCTURE

▲ Emlyn Williams’ Night Must Fall is a
psychological thriller

Here are some key questions to ask yourself in relation to structure:
◼◼ How will you present your narrative?
◼◼ Will the end come at the end, or will you arrange things differently?
◼◼ What effect would you like to have on your reader?
◼◼ How do you think you could use structure to help you achieve the desired
effect?
Works of crime fiction often follow a structure common to the genre. A crime is
often detailed early on but the perpetrator is not revealed until the end. Whilst
this is quite predictable, there are ways to utilise structure to challenge and
surprise the reader.
There are many examples of stories that use unconventional or nonchronological structures. For example, Emlyn William’s play, Night Must Fall,
concerns the actions of a murderer. The opening scene takes place in a court
where the murderer is convicted. In this scene, the audience learns the identity
of one victim, but not that of the second. The next scene is set before the
second murder, and the audience has to follow the character that they know to
be the killer through scenes with other characters, wondering who his second
victim will be. The effect would be very different if both victims’ identities were
revealed in the opening scene.

Write down the key moments in the plot and try reorganising them into a

and the reader’s experience?

NARRATION

Who is telling your story? Is it told by an all-knowing narrator who knows the

point of view of the first character that you introduce.

CHARACTER Revisit the activities
on pages XXX–XXX

How much do you need to know about your characters? How will this
information be conveyed to the reader? Will you introduce the character
upfront, so that the writer tells the reader a lot about this character early on in
the narrative, or will the reader slowly get to know the character as the story
unfolds?

KEY POINT

With practice, you will develop a feel
for imaginative writing. At first, you will
have to consider the aspects of your

automatically as you write. However,
you should always remember to check

GENERATING IDEAS FOR
DIFFERENT PURPOSES

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

GENERATING IDEAS
Any exercise or examination question that requires you to write
imaginatively will give you some sort of starter even if it is
simply a title. This is your starting point from which you will have
to produce further ideas, develop them and turn them into an
effective narrative that is written clearly and accurately.

You may be asked to write in order to explore, to imagine or to entertain.
Before you start trying to generate ideas, you should consider your purpose
and what is expected.
◼◼ To explore. Think about a subject, considering its importance, especially
if the question involves a particular reader or audience. What is important
or significant about the subject? What do other people think about the
subject? How do you react to thinking about it?
◼◼ To imagine. If you are asked to imagine something, the natural response
is to write a narrative. We are all familiar with stories, whether imagined
or real, and this makes telling a story a more comfortable option for many
students in an examination. Remember that good story-telling requires the
same planning and organising as any other kind of writing.
◼◼ To entertain. This requires similar skills to story-telling, with the difference
being that, in order to entertain, your story will have to amuse the reader
and hold their attention. You will not be able to claim that a story is funny;
you will have to tell it in a way that makes your reader smile or laugh.
Now you will need to consider possibilities, sources and other things with
which you may be familiar or unfamiliar. It might help to ask yourself, ‘What
if…?’ There may be characters from stories that you know or from real life that
you could adapt and manipulate or change to suit your purpose. It can be fun
to realise that, in fiction, you can make your characters do things that people
might not do in real life.

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

297

Sharing initial thoughts and asking quick-fire questions of one another are
techniques often used to help generate ideas. When people have to respond
rapidly to questions, they are sometimes surprised how easily new ideas will
appear. Sometimes there can be a chain reaction and a flood of unexpected
ideas will result. The important thing is to engage with the exchange of ideas
and opinions. Doing something different or unusual often triggers the discovery
of new ideas.

CREATIVITY, TEAMWORK

▼ WHAT IF …?
In groups, try asking the question, ‘What if…?’ about people and
situations with which you are familiar. Write down a list of key words
that would provide you with the beginning of a story plan.

When you are required to write imaginatively, you may choose to use a familiar
format, story elements or genre. For example, you could choose to write a
fairytale, a horror story, a science fiction story about space travel, a historical
novel set in a particular time period, a detective story or an adventure story.

writing.

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

PLOT
When you are planning your story’s plot, you should always
consider the question: ‘What is happening, and why is it
happening?
The importance of this question is that it makes you think about
what you want to present in your narrative and how that helps
your purpose. You might produce a wonderful dramatic passage,
or a moving description but, unless these serve the purpose
for which you are writing, you will not have been successful.
Examiners notice this and will expect to find a sense of connected
purpose as they read your work.

▶

FIRST STEPS OF PLOTTING

Before you plot anything, you will need a clear sense of your purpose in
writing. Even a simple sentence will guide you through the planning.

ACTIVITY 1

SKILLS

CRITICAL THINKING,
INTERPRETATION

▼ IDENTIFYING PURPOSE
Working in pairs, list twelve stories that you know. They could be
books, television programmes, films and so on. For each story, write
one sentence to summarise the writer’s purpose. In each case, ask
yourselves what you think the writer was trying to achieve.

Sometimes a writer will set out their reasons for writing a particular book.
For example, Charles Dickens introduced the purpose of his first novel, The
Pickwick Papers, with just one sentence:
The author’s object in this work was to place before the reader a constant
succession of characters and incidents; to paint them in as vivid colours as he
could command; and to render them, at the same time, life-like and amusing.
KEY POINT

The plot is a key step in planning
imaginative writing. Once it has been
established, you can start to apply
details, remembering that further
ideas may come to you as you plan
and write, and that you should be
ready to respond to these ideas. Ideas
can come from thinking about and
developing the events and characters
in your plan, so make use of these
ideas where possible.

ACTIVITY 2

SKILLS

CREATIVITY, TEAMWORK

▼ DEVELOPING PLOT
1 In pairs, follow Dickens’s idea for a succession of characters and
amusing incidents by listing people you know. For each of these
people, try to imagine an amusing incident in which they might easily
become involved. Make brief notes on the incident.
2 Still working in pairs, list the really important events that you want to
include in your narrative, then write one sentence for each of these
points, saying why they are important for readers following your story.

DEVELOPING PLOT

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

Once you have established a clear sense of purpose around your writing, you
can start to develop your plot further. Utilising the simple sentences and initial
ideas you have around your plot, you can start to expand these to create a
fuller image of the narrative you wish to tell.
There are many ways in which you can develop ideas.
◼◼ Using a photo or an image, try applying your idea to the subject matter or
situation shown. This can help you generate a chain of events, setting or
story
◼◼ Consider an alternative perspective from different characters to offer a
differing view or approach to your idea
◼◼ Establish a start, middle and end of your story. Once these key
components have been created, use your ideas to connect them together
and develop them further.
◼◼ Consider the type of plot you wish to use. Many writers experiment with
time, perspective or twists to keep the reader engaged.

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

STRUCTURE
The structure of a piece of writing involves both the order and
the manner in which components of a narrative are assembled.
Ordering the components is one thing, but deciding how they will
fit together within the story is another. Each of the components
will have to fit somehow with the component that precedes
it and the component that follows. For example, will any two
components be closely linked so that we move quickly from
a physical description of a character to an explanation of that
character’s history or an account of some of the things done by
that character?
These are the kinds of decisions that you will have to make as
you plan and write.

▶

Beginnings and endings provide the support for the rest of the narrative in
much the same way as two book-ends hold up a row of books. They are both
important. The introduction sets the narrative in motion and establishes the
tone or mood of the piece: is it relaxed or tense, detailed or in a hurry to move
on? The conclusion provides the author’s final word. Is it a happy one? Is the
writer anxious to finish? Is the fate of major characters something that the
writer is pleased with? Would the writer want to return to this topic, or to this
character?
Look at the opening of Graham Greene’s Brighton Rock:
Hale knew they meant to murder him before he had been in Brighton
three hours. With his inky fingers and his bitten nails, his manner cynical
and nervous, anybody could tell he didn’t belong – belong to the early
summer sun, the cool Whitsun wind off the sea, the holiday crowd.

This is the opening of a psychological drama where a desperate man, all alone,
is filled with the terror of knowing that someone wants to murder him. This is
the first, shocking thing that we are told about him. Immediately, Greene goes
on to describe him in way that confirms what he has just told us: that this man
no longer belongs to life (that is, to the sun, the wind or the crowds of holidaymakers).

SKILLS

▼ IDENTIFYING PURPOSE
In pairs, create a list of points that make up the plot of a story. Write
the opening sentences of this story, so that a character and his or her
situation are introduced quickly and suddenly, so that the reader will
be shocked. Now write a second opening to the same story. This time,
link the two ideas more slowly, to give your reader more time to fully
understand events. How does this change in structure affect the impact
on the reader?

Now look at the end of an equally famous novel. In Lord of the Flies, William
Golding tells the story of a group of schoolboys who find themselves alone on
a tropical island where, without adult supervision, their behaviour deteriorates
into brutal savagery. Two of the boys die as a result of this. At the end, there is
a rescue.
…And in the middle of them, with filthy body, matted hair, and unwiped
nose, Ralph wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart and
the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy.

cruiser A warship.

KEY POINT

Try to structure your sentences,
paragraphs and whole narratives while
bearing in mind the likely responses of
your readers as you link the points that
you make.

The officer, surrounded by these noises, was moved and a little embarrassed.
He turned away to give them time to pull themselves together; and waited,
allowing his eyes to rest on the trim cruiser in the distance.
In this conclusion, it is clear that Ralph has been traumatised by events on the
island and the naval officer is unsure what to make of the boys. Here there is a
powerful contrast between the boys’ loss of civilised standards and the officer
who, with his ‘trim’ warship represents the civilisation that the boys have lost,
and who cannot understand what has happened to them. Golding’s choice to
link the wild-looking boy and the officer on duty in this final scene makes this
contrast all the more powerful.
The ordering here, of Ralph’s memories at the end of the boys’ adventure,
followed by the officer’s failure to understand what the boys have endured,
shows how far they went beyond normal behaviour and is emphasised here in
this short, final paragraph.

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

NARRATION
A narrative has to lead the reader. If the reader does not like the
narrative, it is very easy for them to stop reading.

▶

Non-fiction writing involves a greater level of sharing the writer’s purposes in
writing, such as to inform someone who needs to know something or to discuss
a topic in which the reader is interested. A fictional narrative begins with the idea
of entertaining someone who can choose to stop reading if they are not enjoying
the experience of reading. The narrator has to present something that will trigger a
reader’s interest and satisfaction.
Kenneth Grahame’s The Wind in the Willows was written for children a hundred
years ago. Read the following extract from the beginning of the story, paying
attention to the way in which Grahame seeks to engage the reader.

▼ FROM THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS BY KENNETH GRAHAME

▲ “The Mole had been working very hard all
morning”

The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning
his little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders with
steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he had dust all
over his black fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving
in the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even
his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent and
longing. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down his brush
on the floor, said, ‘Bother!’ and, ‘O blow!, and also, ‘Hang spring-cleaning!’
and bolted out of the house without even waiting to put on his coat.

story starts by focusing on a character, by describing something like the
setting, or by presenting some action. You may discover way of starting
a story that is new to you, so be prepared to learn new techniques.

PAPER 2

FIRST AND THIRD PERSON
NARRATIVES

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

303

The three paragraphs that follow are written in the first person. First person
narratives provide a sense of immediacy as we listen to someone who was
there and saw for themselves what actually happened and what was actually
said.
I first began to take notice of the family when I ran into the mother on the
way to the shops. She smiled and reached out her arm to touch my shoulder
then allowed her hand to rest for a moment on the lapel of my jacket.
‘Will you thank your wife for me?’ Over her shoulder I could see the two
little ones. Margaret had taken them in when their cat had been run over and
looked after them until their mother had returned from the vets.
‘That’s OK,’ I said. ‘They were no trouble.’ I nodded towards her children
who were about to catch her up. ‘We enjoyed looking after them.’
The next three paragraphs are written in the third person and are more
detached, as if the writer is observing from a distance rather than being
involved. This can give the impression that the writer is giving a more balanced
or reliable view of things, and is not affected by the things that he or she writes
about.
There had been rumours about the disused mine for years. Tom and his friend
had played around the entrance when they were small, but, understandably,
when their parents had found out a fuss had been made and the owners were
obliged to seal it up.
Still the rumours had continued. As the boys grew older, and their circle of
friendship had widened, they had encountered other boys from further afield
who had also heard the rumours. At school and at home there had been hand
tools that they had learnt to use, hammers, chisels, crow-bars and spades. At
school there had been adventure stories about children their own age.
They met one morning at what had been the mine entrance, carrying tools
borrowed from garden sheds and garages, tools belonging to parents who
would not have agreed to lend them for this particular purpose.
What difference do you think could be made by choosing one of these two
narrative styles? How might the impact on the reader change, depending on
whether the story is narrated in the first or third person?

ACTIVITY 3
KEY POINT

Remember that, as the writer of a
narrative, you will have to decide the
character of the narrator. Is it you, a

is detached from the story and treats
events like a newspaper reporter?

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

CHARACTERS
Characters influence readers in several ways: through our direct
awareness of what they think, do and say; through their influence
on other characters; and through what the author tells us about
them.

▶

Characters are not just the people in a story. One of them may be the narrator
of the story. They may be the people in the story about whom we learn from the
author, in a third person narrative. A character may never actually appear in a
story, but they may still be of importance and we may learn about them from the
narrator or from other characters.

▼ LEARNING ABOUT CHARACTERS
In pairs, read the following excerpts from pieces of imaginative writing and
identify how you learn about each of the characters. Do you learn about
them through their own thoughts and actions, through the narrator’s
descriptions and judgements, or through another character’s eyes?
◾◾ He thought she was stunning. You could tell when he spoke about
her and when he waited after school, when most of us boys had set
off for the park. You could tell when we asked him about her. Most
telling was the cruel moment when someone said that she had been
running after one of the boys in the other class.
◾◾ I noticed them gradually, as they crawled out of the rotten
woodwork onto the paving slabs. What use they were I could never
tell and so, before they could reach the dog’s bowl, I lifted my foot
and ground them into the concrete. Mary wouldn’t have liked it but
then she was not there to see what I had done.
◾◾ He was the biggest rabbit in the litter. Since they had arrived in the
straw, under the lamp, he had quickly learnt to barge his brothers
and sisters to one side so that he always got the best feed. Now that
they were weaned the others simply moved aside when he wanted a
drink or the best spot in the warm straw bed.

REVEALING CHARACTER

An author has to decide whether characters should be revealed by someone
else such as the narrator, who passes on what they know or feel about them,
or by the characters themselves so that readers can see the characters in
action and make up their own minds about them.
Sometimes the reader needs to know something about a character that the
character would be reluctant to reveal themselves. Then the author, or another
character, might need to tell the reader.
She was far too modest to tell anyone about her bravery, how she had forced
her way into the burning house to rescue her neighbours’ children. When she
forgets to put on her gloves you can see the scars still.
Sometimes the reader is better convinced when they can see an event for
themselves, rather than being told about it.
She put down the phone and rushed outside. She looked over to the other
neighbours’ houses but there were no lights to be seen. Somehow she found
the strength to force open the door and make her way in. Moments later she
emerged with a small child whom she laid carefully on the grass, away from
the house. By now a red glow showed itself from all the upstairs windows
and smoke was streaming from the door. From some distance away came the
sound of a siren. The girl paused, took a deep breath and turned back into
the smoke.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ use speech to reveal character.

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

MONOLOGUES AND DIALOGUES
Monologues represent the thoughts or speech of a single person
or character, whereas dialogues are exchanges between more
than one person or character. These serve different purposes
in imaginative writing: monologues can be more fluid, like our
thoughts, whereas dialogues can portray arguments, or love or
perhaps progress towards a resolution of some question.

▶

The following extracts are taken from Susan Hill’s novel, I’m the King of the
Castle. When Edmund Hooper is about eleven, his father tells him that another
boy is coming to live in their house, along with his mother who is to be their
housekeeper. Edmund’s mother had died a few years before. The story
continues.
Hooper began to mould plasticine between his hands, for another layer to the
geological model, standing as a board beside the window. He thought of the
boy called Kingshaw, who was coming.
‘It is my house,’ he thought, ‘it is private, I got here first. Nobody should
come here.’
SUBJECT VOCABULARY

monologue speech or thoughts of
someone alone
dialogue two or more persons involved in a
conversation

Hooper’s words here form a monologue. They are private words, whether
spoken or thought. Through them Hooper reveals his determination that no
one should share the house with him. No one else can know about these
thoughts and the author has given the reader a private view, as it were, into the
boy’s jealous determination.
Soon the boys are left together.
He walked round the table, towards the window. Kingshaw stepped back as
he came.
‘Scaredy!’
‘No.’
‘When my father dies,’ Hooper said, ‘this house will belong to me. I shall be
master. It’ll all be mine.’
‘That’s nothing. It’s only an old house.’
Here the story moves on with a dialogue, and we can see the very beginning
of the bullying and rivalry that will result in a death. This failure of the boys to
cooperate can easily be presented in a natural situation such as this one, more
so than using someone’s private thoughts.

Speech and private thoughts provide a writer with useful tools for introducing
characters. What people say and think when they are alone, or think that they
are alone, can be very revealing about their character. Satirical magazines such
as Private Eye make good use of this technique. One early novel in the English
language, Pamela by Samuel Richardson, uses thoughts from a private diary to
reveal important information.

CREATING EFFECT
In pairs, identify the words and phrases that are used to create effective
description in the following passage adapted from The War of the
Worlds. In H.G. Wells’s story of an invasion by creatures from Mars,
there is a description of one their spaceships that serves to enhance the
drama of its discovery. When the novel was dramatised and broadcast
like live news on American radio, it caused widespread panic as
listeners thought they were listening to a news bulletin.

▼ FROM THE WAR OF THE WORLDS BY H.G. WELLS
The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the scattered
splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent.
The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over
and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation. It had
a diameter of about thirty metres. He approached the mass, surprised at
the size and more so at the shape, since most meteorites are rounded more
or less completely. It was, however, still so hot from its flight through the
air as to forbid his near approach. A stirring noise with its cylinder he
ascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not
occurred to him that it might be hollow.
Suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker, the ashy
incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the circular edge of
the end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand. A
large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought his
heart into his mouth.

KEY POINT

An imaginative choice of words can
enhance a description. For example,
what is the difference in effect
between ‘the cat sat on the mat’ and
‘the cat sprawled on the mat’?

And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the cylinder
was rotating on its body. It was such a gradual movement that he
discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been near
him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference.
Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated, until he heard a
muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or
so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash. The cylinder was an artificial
hollow with an end that screwed out! Something within the cylinder was
unscrewing the top!

This sense of ‘the right word’ is a strong one and, just as we can realise
this when we are writing, or speaking, so we appreciate it when we listen to
someone else or read what they have to say.
Read the two versions of the same account that follows.

VERSION A
Before a visit to the dentist when I was about fourteen, I liked ice cream.
Then I had a tooth removed, under a general anaesthetic.
Soon I was dreaming that I was eating an ice cream. The ice cream tasted of
tomatoes. I had never liked tomatoes. For six months afterwards I didn’t fancy
ice cream until I made myself buy one and found that it tasted all right.

VERSION B
Before a visit to the dentist when I was about fourteen, I was unable to resist
ice cream. Then I had a tooth removed, under a general anaesthetic.

associations between things allow the writer to provide quick links or

elementary precautions that anyone should take before lighting a fire. Despite

stuffed under the brush wood, then flare up through the heavier branches
until the flames roared skywards over the wood and waste material that had
been piled high.
When a stiff breeze suddenly blew amongst them they watched horrified
as the flames licked across to the garden shed which held their toys. Within

when you speak to other people. With a
little thought you can be just as flexible
when writing.

ACTIVITY 4

SKILLS

Consider the following instructions or comments:
◼◼ ‘Keep an eye on him.’
◼◼ ‘Your homework is dreadful.’
How do you think you would respond to these instructions or statements? Do
you think you would respond differently if they were rephrased as follows?
◼◼ ‘Just try to keep an eye on him.’
◼◼ ‘Your homework is rather disappointing.’
In the second list, the writer is trying to reduce or soften the impact of their
words. The first instruction becomes a suggestion, a hint that perhaps you
should keep an eye on someone. The second instruction becomes a hint that
you might be pleased to have tried something. Finally, the comment that your
homework is not good is amended so that, rather than sounding angry, the
teacher is trying to make you feel regret for letting them down.

ADAPTIVE LEARNING, CREATIVITY,
INNOVATION

▼ USING SUBTLE LANGUAGE
Working on your own, extend each of the six instructions or comments that you have just read so that they make
it clear what is going on. You could follow the pattern of the following example sentence in order to do so.
‘I don’t think this is going to work; the glue has already set’.
Try to use subtle words and phrases to do so, so that you suggest what is going on rather than stating it.

IMAGINATIVE WRITING

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

SENTENCES FOR EFFECT

This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ create effects in imaginative
writing through the way in
which sentences are organised.

Sentences have various ways of being organised: short,
compound or complex. All these types produce different effects.

SENTENCE TYPES

doing wheelies Balancing a bicycle on its
rear wheel while riding it.
dog collar An informal description of the
white collar worn by the clergy of some
Christian churches.

▶
In her novel, The Risk of Darkness, Susan Hill describes a young woman priest
walking home. At the time of the novel’s setting, the sight of a woman priest
was a novelty in England. A dog collar is a popular description of the white
collar that many clergy wear across the throat. Doing a wheelie involves riding
a bike while balancing on the rear wheel.
A boy bounced past her on a bicycle doing wheelies over the cobbles. Jane
smiled at him. He did not respond but when he had gone by, turned and
stared over his shoulder. She was used to it. Here she was, a girl, wearing
jeans, and a dog collar. People were still surprised.
The first sentence is a simple one containing only one main verb. It is also
quite loose, as the main verb is found at the start of the sentence. This
sentence could be stopped after just five words and it would still make sense.
What do you think is achieved by including the rest of the sentence?

▶▶ In pairs, find the other two places in the extract where a sentence could
be stopped early. What effect does the writer achieve by building up the
sentence in this way?

ACTIVITY 1

SKILLS

ANALYSIS, CREATIVITY

▼ DEVELOPING SENTENCES
▲ A mountain biker demonstrating a wheelie

Decide how you could develop the following sentences. Write down the
purpose for extending each one, then add to it.
◼◼ The door opened.
◼◼ They could see the dog.
◼◼ The streets were always the same.
What sort of sentences have you produced? Are they loose, periodic or
balanced? Are they simple, compound or complex?
We have worked on just the first sentence in the paragraph from The Risk
of Darkness. The third and fifth sentences grow in a similar way to the first
sentence, but what about the other sentences? They are all simple, periodic
sentences, but are related to the more complicated sentences that they follow.
Look again at the third sentence:
He did not respond but when he had gone by, turned and stared over his
shoulder.
Here there is much detail added to the basic sentence and the boy’s reaction
to Jane is made clear. Her reaction is conveyed in only five words:
She was used to it.

ANALYSIS

▼ THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT SENTENCE TYPES
In pairs, decide what effect Jane achieves by revealing her reaction in
this simple sentence without further detail. What effect is achieved in
the sixth sentence?

OTHER WAYS OF ORGANISING
SENTENCES

We have seen the way in which strong effects can be created when sentences
of different types are carefully placed together. Now we are going to look at
other ways of organising sentences. Read the following piece of imaginative
writing.
It was icy, bitter cold. The washing hung frozen on the lines and icicles
reached down from gutters that were filled with water that could no longer
flow, held in place by unbelievable low temperatures. He looked for his
gloves. He had left them to one side, by the door, but the space on the shelf
was empty now and only the marks which he had brushed in the dust
remained to remind him that his memory was not playing tricks.
Instead of showing a reaction to something, as with the short sentences in
Hill’s paragraph from The Risk of Darkness, these long, complex sentences
develop the ideas in the short sentences that they follow. Of course, the pairs
of sentences here also develop a wider idea – the drama of this character and
the bitter cold he faced.

ACTIVITY 3

SKILLS

CREATIVITY, INNOVATION

▼ DEVELOPING AN IDEA USING SENTENCE TYPES
Working alone, decide on an idea that you would like to develop in one
paragraph. Write down that idea in one sentence and then start. If you
are writing on paper use only every third line to give yourself room to
try out words and make improvements to what you have written as you
make progress. Your paragraph should be a minimum of four sentences.

ACTIVITY 4
KEY POINT

While you are writing, be prepared
to stop occasionally and ask yourself
whether the words you have written
will achieve your purpose or purposes.

SKILLS

CREATIVITY, INNOVATION,
COLLABORATION

▼ USING DIFFERENT SENTENCE PATTERNS
In pairs or in groups, try to develop an idea using different patterns of
sentences, investigating what might serve your purposes and focusing
on what you were aiming to achieve at the outset.
Remember, deciding your purpose is something that you have to do
before you start to write, you must bear it in mind while you are writing.

SAMPLE QUESTIONS

▶

The following is a sample examination question with a sample response and a
commentary to follow.

▶▶ Write about a time when you, or someone you know, had an unexpected
experience. Your response could be real or imagined.

(30 marks)

It was a warm summer’s day and we set off from the farmyard to round up some
sheep. Early in the summer all the sheep were rounded up so that they could
be dipped, pushed one at a time through a long narrow bath that contained an
insecticide that would protect them from flies that would burrow into their flesh and
lay their eggs in the wounds that they had created. The condition is called fly-strike.
The sheep we were looking for had spread themselves over the moor and across
to an open area of land between the road and the sea. With us we had two sheep
dogs. Once we had crossed the road we sent the dogs round in wide sweeping
paths to move the sheep together into a flock that we could move across the
road and back to the farm.
Ahead of us we could see the dogs, their heads up as they looked from side to side
for sheep that were standing still as if wondering whether to move or not. They
moved on, and left us to follow, pushing the flock up towards the road. Then, as the
ground sloped more steeply away beneath our feet, we could see them no longer.
Below us, to our left, we could hear the sea crashing into the rocks at the foot of
the cliffs. Suddenly, from ahead of us, came the blare of a fog horn.
We hadn’t noticed the clouds that had come up behind us. They had yet to blot
out the sun and we were more aware of the growing flock to our right that was
moving slowly towards the road. Ahead of us the dogs were barking furiously
now and we stepped forwards to see what was troubling them. Again the fog
horn blared, this time almost above us.
Suddenly, the fog had surrounded us; damp and chill, it had been blown up behind
us as the breeze had lifted. We could see nothing of dogs or sheep, but we could
hear them and the rocks that were directly below us. To one side we leant on the
round wall of the tower that housed the fog horn, built into the cliff. Around us
sheep and dogs continued to move carefully, but we two-legged creatures were far
less stable on the cliff face and so we waited until the breeze dropped and the fog
slid away off the cliff and moved slowly, back down to the water.

COMMENTARY

This is an explanation of how this sample answer was written. Try following this
process in your own imaginative writing.
PLANNING THE PLOT
The planning of this piece is focused on the fog surrounding the two
characters who were caught unawares. The rounding up of the sheep provides
a context, a background or explanation as to why the characters were on the
sloping cliffs where fog was more of a danger, a sense of drama that could be
used to a lesser or greater extent by the writer.
As the gathering of the sheep proceeds, the task becomes a distraction for
the characters as they watch the sheep, rather than the weather behind them.
As the drama develops we can feel the slope of the cliffs, the dogs disappear
from sight, somewhere ahead, then we hear the waves and the sudden burst
of the fog horn. The reader’s senses provide a link to the drama.
CHECKING
This is where you must read the passage aloud or, under exam conditions,
imagine the sound of a voice reading it aloud. This is the most effective way of
checking your writing. If the punctuation is poor, you will find yourself unable
to read the passage fluently, and if there are lapses in the grammar then the
sense of the writing will not be clear. If this happens, ask yourself, ‘What is the
subject of this sentence?’ and ‘What are we told about the subject?’. These
questions should help you to clarify the sentence.

Allow yourself 45 minutes to respond to this question with a piece that is
300–400 words in length.
Exchange your finished piece with a partner, then read each other’s work and
exchange comments. Try to suggest ways of improving each other’s work
rather than simply finding faults.

KEY POINT

Engaging your audience is crucial.
Remember that good imaginative
writing usually involves something that
the author wants to say. If the author
wants something to be read, the reader
must be given a reason to start and
encouragement to keep reading.

COURSEWORK OVERVIEW
The coursework option of the English Language A course, also
called Paper 3, provides an alternative to examination Paper 2
and covers the same ground in different ways.
UNDERSTANDING THE COURSEWORK
OPTION

COURSEWORK TASKS FOR PAPER 3
Assignment A
Poetry and prose texts: study
and analyse selections from a
range of fictional poetry and prose
texts, taken from Section B of the
Edexcel Anthology.
In practice, this piece could focus
on no more than two texts (but it
must be on more than one).
Assignment B
Imaginative writing: explore and
develop imaginative writing skills.
The emphasis of this assignment
is very much on your own ideas
and ways of expressing yourself.

SUBJECT VOCABULARY

plagiarism taking someone else's work
and passing it off as your own

▶

The written coursework that you will complete for Paper 3 is worth 40 per
cent of your total English Language marks (the same as Paper 2). You have
to submit two assignments, (known as units). One based on Section B of the
Edexcel Anthology, which will be assessed for your reading skills. The other
will be a piece of personal imaginative writing, which is entirely your own work
and which will be assessed your writing skills.
You must work under the guidance of your teacher, who is authorised to
assess your coursework and who has to authenticate it, but your coursework
is something that you are in charge of. It is vital that you do not copy or
borrow writing from elsewhere and then pretend it is your own, and you will be
required to sign a form stating that the work is your own.

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
Coursework has many advantages.
◼◼ You have more time to plan, think about and improve your assignments.
◼◼ They do not have to be done under controlled conditions.
◼◼ You have more freedom to choose what to write about and what to submit.
◼◼ Your coursework folder is solid evidence of what you can do in your own
time and to the best of your abilities.
However, there are disadvantages too.
◼◼ Coursework may take up too much of your time. The two assignments
together are worth 40 per cent of the GCSE, whereas the exam is worth 60
per cent, so exam preparation must be given priority.
◼◼ You may be tempted to take short cuts. If you cheat and get found out, the
penalties can be very severe. Teachers and moderators are very good at
detecting plagiarism. It is simply not worth the risk. Furthermore, you learn
nothing from cheating in terms of developing your writing skills.

WORD COUNT
There is no definite requirement regarding the length of coursework pieces,
except that they should be as long as they need to be. Most students'
coursework units are between 450 and 1000 words, but the board advises that
each assignment should be between 450 and 600 words in length. There is no
penalty for exceeding this recommendation. However, the commentary part of
Assignment A should be no more than 200 words.
The best guide is to think about your chosen purpose and or audience. If your
unit fits both of these requirements, then it will be the right length.

AUTHENTICITY
Near the end of the course, you will be asked to sign a Coursework
Authentication to confirm that you produced your coursework independently.
Teachers are always warned to look out for signs of plagiarism or excessive
assistance from others. You should therefore work independently, although it is
a good idea to show others what you have written and ask for verbal feedback.
If you are unsure, ask your teacher what level of feedback is appropriate.

PRESENTATION OF THE WORK
Each piece of coursework should contain your name, the date on which
the work was completed, the mark awarded and a brief teacher comment
justifying the mark. This comment should be based on the assessment criteria
for the mark range awarded.
Coursework pieces may be handwritten or word-processed.

STANDARDISATION OF COURSEWORK
Towards the end of the course, Pearson Edexcel will request a sample of
coursework to be sent to a Pearson Edexcel-appointed coursework moderator.
The moderator will either confirm the marks awarded by the teachers in
your centre or will adjust marks accordingly. English departments always
standardise the marking by sharing out work from each class amongst all the
teachers in the department, so that the marking of all the year group is
consistent.

USING PREVIOUS CHAPTERS

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES
Reading (Assignment A):
AO1 Read and understand a variety
of texts, selecting and interpreting
information, ideas and perspectives
AO2 Understand and analyse how
writers use linguistic and structural
devices to achieve their effects
AO3 Explore links and connections
between writers’ ideas and
perspectives, as well as how these
are conveyed.
Writing (Assignment B):
AO4 Communicate effectively and
imaginatively, adapting form, tone
and register of writing for specific
purposes and audiences
AO5 Write clearly, using a range of
vocabulary and sentence structures,
with appropriate paragraphing and
accurate spelling, grammar and
punctuation

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES
The assessment objectives for the coursework and for Papers 1 and 2 are the
same. This means that the chapter on the fiction texts from the Anthology will
give you plenty of activities and information that can be used to help you with
Assignment A. For example, if your assignment is to compare two Anthology
texts in some way, you should work your way carefully through the activities
on those texts, as they will give you ideas and quotations to use in your
coursework.
Likewise, for Assignment B, all the activities for Paper 2 Section B: Imaginative
writing (pages XXX–XXX) will be very helpful for your coursework. There are
sections on generating ideas, plotting, characterisation, description, using
monologues and dialogues, structure, and so on, which you will need to help
you create a good story. The fiction stories in the Anthology may also help to
give you inspiration. Look at the way that they: use technique and structure;
handle character, situation, mood and theme; and so on.
Writing to explore, imagine and entertain also gives you a wide range of
options, including stories, descriptions, and magazine or newspaper articles. If
you decide to write an article, consult the section on articles in the section on
transactional writing (pages XXX–XXX). However, remember that the purpose
of the coursework is not to argue or explain but to explore or entertain.
People often write best when they can draw on their own experiences, such as
a powerful memory or an eventful day. You could write to explore your feelings
and thoughts, or you could use these experiences as part of an entertaining
account or story. Your approach to this assignment can be light-hearted
or deeply serious, and you can submit imaginative responses to any of the
Anthology texts.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
◼◼ understand how to approach
Assignment A (reading skills).

ASSIGNMENT
TEXT ANTHOLOGY:
A: POETRY
FICTION
AND PROSE TEXTS

ASSIGNMENT A: POETRY AND PROSE TEXTS
Your teacher will set you a task that requires you to write in
response to any two or more poetry or prose texts from the
Pearson Edexcel International GCSE English Anthology. You should
choose the texts yourself.

▶

PARTS OF THE ASSIGNMENT

Assignment A will be in two parts.
◼◼ Part 1 will be a response to the set assignment and will be MARKED out of
24 marks, with 6 marks for AO1 and 18 marks for AO2.
◼◼ Part 2 will be a short commentary explaining why you chose the texts
THAT you discussed in the assignment. It is worth 6 marks for AO1. This is
one of the reasons why you should choose the texts yourself.
There is therefore a total of 30 marks for this assignment, which corresponds
to 20 per cent of the International GCSE in English Language.

WORD COUNT

You should aim to write roughly 500–600 words for Part 1 and about 200
words for Part 2, the commentary. You will not be penalised for writing more
for Part 1, but you will not be given more marks because you have written
more; for Part 2, you must keep it short, since it is only worth 6 marks.

ANTHOLOGY POETRY AND PROSE
TEXTS

For Assignment A, you will write about texts from Section B of the Anthology.
◼◼ ‘Disabled’ by Wilfred Owen.
◼◼ ‘Out, ––’ by Robert Frost.
◼◼ ‘An Unknown Girl’ by Moniza Alvi.
◼◼ ‘The Bright Lights of Sarajevo’ by Tony Harrison.
◼◼ ‘Still I Rise’ by Maya Angelou.
◼◼ ‘The Necklace’ by Guy de Maupassant.
◼◼ ‘The Road Home’ by Rose Tremain.
◼◼ ‘Whistle and I’ll Come to You’ by (from The Woman in Black), Susan Hill.
◼◼ ‘Night’ by Alice Munro.

THE QUESTION

The assignment could be a detailed analysis of the language in two texts,
or it could focus on a theme that two texts have in common. The following
questions are examples of questions.

▶▶ Discuss how the authors use language to present the situation and
characters in ‘Night’ and ‘The Bright Lights of Sarajevo’.
▶▶ Consider any two texts about aspects of growing up. How do they approach
their subject matter?

TIPS ON THE READING
ASSIGNMENT
HINT

Remember that teachers and moderators
are human beings and that they will
respond to genuine engagement (that is,
when students are doing their best to think
for themselves). They will be less impressed
by responses that show little individuality.

USING ACTIVITIES FROM
PREVIOUS CHAPTERS

All assignments for this unit must address the Assessment Objectives for
reading. In simple terms, this means that you must:
◼◼ show that you have read your chosen texts thoroughly and understand
them well enough to develop an interpretation
◼◼ show how language is used to achieve effects.
For this assignment, you must not submit:
◼◼ work based on Section A of the Anthology
◼◼ imaginative or empathetic responses to Section B texts (although these
could be submitted for Assignment B).
1 ‘Analyse, not summarise’ is a useful motto to bear in mind. It is assumed
that you could summarise the texts if you were asked to do so, but nobody
is asking you to summarise.
2 Try to develop your own opinion on texts and think for yourself. Do not rely
only on teacher’s notes. To access the higher grade bands, you have to
develop a thorough and perceptive understanding of language and structure.
3 A key feature of higher-grade work is that it explores ‘how both language
and structure are used by writers to achieve effects’. The word ‘explore’
implies that there is a value in trying to be fresh and individual in your
approach. Make your points tentatively, considering different ideas and
using phrases such as ‘this could be seen as…’, ‘on the other hand this may
be…’, and ‘another meaning of this might be…’. This kind of writing shows
that you are thinking about the texts and responding to them. Although you
may misunderstand a text, it is equally true that there is no ‘right answer’ –
only good and less good answers.
4 You must write about the language of the texts and how this helps to
convey meaning and fulfil the writer’s purpose. Just as in the exams, it is
always better to write in some detail about a few quotations, than to quote
frequently but fail to comment in detail.
5 It is best to focus closely only on the two texts chosen, and not to bring in
any other texts that you might think of.
6 You must back up all of your points with clearly relevant and well-explained
evidence (think ‘P-E-E’!).
Once you have chosen the two pieces that you are going to write about, you
need to work carefully through the pages on those pieces that you will find in
the chapter on Paper 2.
Once you have done this, work through the lesson, ‘Putting it into practice’, on
page XXX. On this page, you will find the following question.

▶▶ Look again at the poem ‘Electricity Comes to Cocoa Bottom’ and show how
the poet presents the relationship between the physical environment and the
events and feelings portrayed.
This is an exam-style question, but you could adapt it to suit the coursework,
substituting your chosen chosen texts and themes for ‘Electricity Comes to
Cocoa Bottom’ and its themes. For example, you could ask the following
question.

FICTION
AND PROSE TEXTS

▶▶ Show how the poet presents the relationship between the physical
environment and the events and feelings being shown in two poems or texts:
‘An Unknown Girl’ and ‘The Bright Lights of Sarajevo’.
Read through the following student answer to this question.

‘The Bright Lights of Sarajevo’ describes how, at night, in besieged and bombdamaged Sarajevo, the poet is surprised to find young people from different
ethnic groups strolling about in the darkness, and how boys meet girls despite
the danger and darkness, whilst also hinting at the violent events of the siege.
The poem shows us the paradoxes of wartime: how ethnic conflict is
submerged at night; how romance can burst into life in a terrible and fearful
environment; how tender or romantic feelings can exist in the same place
where people were killed by shells earlier in the war.

▲ In his depiction of Sarajevo and its
inhabitants, Harrison brings out the
contradictions of wartime

HARRISON

▼ WHAT IT TELLS US ABOUT THE
ENVIRONMENT

‘To get the refills they wheel home in
prams’

Shows how the Sarajevans improvise with
whatever they have to cope with in the
situation

The language of the poem is mostly straightforward and even quite
conversational. This helps to make the poem more realistic: it sounds
spontaneous and is more accessible to us (especially perhaps to the first
readers of the poem in The Guardian). Perhaps Harrison was trying to
convey the sense that he was there, recording his on-the-spot impressions.
Throughout the poem Harrison conveys the contrast between the activities of
ordinary and peaceable Sarajevans, and the strange and difficult conditions
in which they live, with evidence of large-scale violence all around them. The
contrast is expressed in the language. Sometimes one phrase has associations
or suggests a feeling very different from those of another.

CONTRAST

We are all used to queuing as an everyday
activity, but the idea of being shot at as
part of the routine is shocking.

‘Queuing for the… grams of
bread / often dodging snipers on
the way’

As the poem goes on, we can see a group or chain of words associated with
each other, which denote peaceful activities, but these contrast or clash with
another chain of words associated with a wartime environment. The effect is
to make us aware of how the people are doing their utmost to keep living in
the midst of danger. You could say that the ideas of the poem are structured
around this contrast.

THE COMMENTARY

KEY POINT

Write about the motivations that
inspired you to choose the two texts.
What do you find really stimulating in
them?

323

In your commentary, you should aim to explain why you chose the two texts
and talk about interpreting ideals and perspectives in relation to each text. To
do this, you could adopt the following plan.
◼◼ Explain why you chose the two texts – it is important to show that you
have thought about which texts to write about, rather than simply done
what you were told to do. For example, you might say that you were
interested in them because they both explored aspects of a theme in
which you are interested. Mention that you have read the other texts in the
Anthology and why these two were more interesting to write about.
◼◼ Interpreting ideas and perspectives – say something about these in
relation to each piece about which you have written. For example, if you
wrote about ‘Still I Rise’, Maya Angelou, you might say that the poem
is written from the perspective of an intelligent and passionate black
American girl at a time when the social status of African-Americans was
finally improving.
If you have worked through the relevant sections on the texts that you have
chosen, and have understood how to create an effective and perceptive
answer about your chosen texts, then you should now be ready to plan your
own piece of coursework. Good luck!

ASSIGNMENT B: IMAGINATIVE WRITING
The second assignment is a piece of personal and imaginative
writing. This will be based on a topic, or topics, that will be given
to you by your teacher.

▶

The purpose or purposes of your piece of writing should be any or all of the
following: to explore, to imagine, to entertain. In this way, it is like the imaginative
writing task set in Section B of Paper 2.
The assignment is worth the same amount as Assignment A, making it worth
20% of the International GCSE in English Language.
Your teacher will set the question or choice of questions. The topic could be
suggested by a piece in the Anthology, such as the following question.

▶▶ ‘Free from the chains.’ Write an imaginative piece ending with these words.
Alternatively, it could be an unrelated topic, perhaps relating to an image or
concept such as the following suggestions.

▶▶ The dream.
▶▶ Anxious moments.
▶▶ The shame of it.
ELEMENTS OF STORYTELLING

Turn to the Paper 2 chapter on imaginative writing (pages XXX–XXX) and work
through as many of the activities as you can, particularly the sections on plot,
structure, vocabulary for effect and sentences for effect. This will focus your
mind on narrative methods and techniques.

ACTIVITY 1
KEY POINT

Your goal should be expressive,
well structured and grammatically
accurate writing with good spelling and
punctuation.

▼ G
 OALS IN WRITING
There are three vital goals. You have to demonstrate: firstly, how
expressively and how appropriately you can write; secondly, how
effectively you can structure your writing; and finally, how accurately
you can write in terms of spelling, punctuation and grammar.
Write a detailed plan for one of the suggested titles above and two
good opening paragraphs in response to your chosen title.

FICTION WRITING

1 Write from your own perspective. Why set your story in a small town
in another country, about which you know little, when there must be
hundreds of stories near your home that are waiting to be told?
2 Remember you don’t have to be totally truthful, even when writing a story
based on your own experience; you can imagine and pretend.
3 If you are aiming for the higher grades then you should consider
presenting your work in a fresh or original way. You need to show skill in
engaging and keeping your reader’s interest.
4 Experiment with form. For example, try telling a story from different
angles, from the points of view of different characters.
5 In stories, create characters as well as atmosphere; give them motives.
Don’t just focus on drama and violence: think of consequences.
Finally, remember:
◼◼ coursework takes careful thought and planning
◼◼ seek advice, but write as yourself in your own words
◼◼ use spell checkers carefully – it is allowed!

ACTIVITY 2

▼ MARKING A RESPONSE
Before you start to plan your own story, here is an example of a piece
written by a GCSE candidate. Read it and assess it using the mark
scheme.

ESCAPE
The blade glinted in the light of the half-moon, hanging over the whispy dark
clouds. Then a piercing beam from a spotlight, or was it headlights, shot
through the darkness, lighting up trees, bushes and huge muddy puddles
along the track through the woods. A shadowy figure ducked into the thick
vegetation. He bent down and sawed at the padlock around a chain circling
his leg, then, when it fell away onto the ground, he stood up, and went out into
the cover of the night…
His name was John O’Malley, leutenant – a sniper – the best in the regiment.
During his escape from the prison camp in Germany, he had managed to
keep his Lee-Enfield scope under his greatcoat. Just as he was preparing
to move on swiftly, there was the roar of a vehecle. He ducked into the dark
ditch, crouching in the dank greenery. Once the lorry was safely out of earshot
he moved on through the trees, then descended down the frosty slopes to a
village. If anyone had been watching as he flitted from tree to tree, he would
have appeared like some woodland creature: but nobody was watching.
The streets were deserted, no-one observed him as he slipped along them.
Then he muttered to himself: ‘Damn! Just my luck,’ as he came in view
of a checkpoint. There was nothing else he could do, so, sweating, he

approached and handed his forged papers to the obnoxsious-looking guard.
He scrutenised them with a bad-tempered expression on his face. Then he
handed them back. The guard shouted something and the gate lifted. He
bought a ticket, for he spoke good German, and boarded the train near the
massive, snorting steam engine. For the first time he felt that he might really
escape. He almost dared to relax a little, as he settled into a window seat.
Then suddenly there was a sound of boots and someone shouting ‘Halt! Halt!’
as SS soldiers poured onto the train and issued abrupt commands. The exits
were blocked, one of them asked for his papers, but was not satisfied with
them. He shouted out some questions and ordered him off the train. John’s
heart sank, he was back to square one.
He was shoved into the back of a van with a couple of dangerous-looking
dogs and various bits of equipment. The door was locked. Drearily, he
wondered what his chances were of escaping again on the way to the camp,
or another, tougher camp. At least he was alive, and in one peice, he thought,
it was something to be grateful for. At least the Germans did not exicute
escaped prisoners. Not usually, in any case.
There might be another chance, he told himself, he must stay alert…
Although this response not perfect, it has many good points.
What marks for AO4 (out of 20) and AO5 (out of 10) do you think this
should be given?

▼ THE STRUCTURE OF ‘ESCAPE’
In pairs or individually, copy and complete the following table, dividing
‘Escape’ into five sections and writing a phrase to sum up the content
of each section. You could begin by summarising the content of each
paragraph, bearing in mind that a section may contain more than one
paragraph.

PLANNING STRUCTURE

KEY POINT

You can structure your writing around
functions such as narrative, or
dialogue. Not only does this maintain
the reader’s interest, it also provides a
framwork around which you can fill out
the piece.

TEXT
ASSIGNMENT
ANTHOLOGY:
B: IMAGINATIVE
FICTION WRITING

Another way to think about structure is to plan which types or functions of
writing you are going to use.
Even though you may only write around 600 words, using several types or
functions of writing will give your story a sense of variety, which will help to
keep your reader interested.
These types or functions of writing are:
◼◼ description: many stories begin with brief scene-setting descriptions
◼◼ narrative: this tells us what happens and includes tiny actions and
movements, such as ‘he frowned’, which are important in storytelling
◼◼ dialogue: speech often brings a story to life and conveys feelings very
directly and convincingly
◼◼ thoughts and feelings: thoughts that are not included in the dialogue but
are included when a character is thinking to themselves, which can help to
give your characters more depth
◼◼ background information: it may be useful to tell the reader something
about a character or place.
When you are planning, try to bring in several of these – it should help you to
structure the piece. Even if you decide to have only one character, you may
find that you can even use dialogue as it can be useful to have your character
say something to themselves.

ACTIVITY 4

▼ USING TYPES OF WRITING TO PLAN STRUCTURE
1 Using the following checklist, tick the functions of writing that you
will probably use and write a short note on how you might use each
one. You could concentrate on using one more than the others if you
like. For example, your piece could be almost entirely description or
dialogue: there are no exact rules, though some variety is surely a
good idea.
□□ Description
□□ Narrative
□□ Dialogue
□□ Thoughts and feelings
□□ Background information
2 Go back to ‘Escape’ and read it again. Find examples of each of the
five functions of writing and label them. Notice how easily the writer
slips from one function to another, so that the reader does not notice.

MAKING CHOICES ABOUT
CONTENT AND GENRE

Answer the following questions about ‘Escape’:

▶▶ Why is it probably best to base your story on one simple incident?
▶▶ Why is it best to have only one or two main characters?
▶▶ A lot of young people writing stories tend to include too many events and
characters: why do you think this is?

PAPER 32

CONFIDENTIAL: Uncorrected WIP proof, NOT for circulation or distribution. © Pearson Education.

HINT

‘Escape’ has: one main character; two
or three clear settings; a simple (though
dramatic) situation; two incidents; a
difficult problem; and an ending that was
conclusive for the time being, though it left
a cliffhanger. In other words, it contained
more than enough for 400–500 words.
Don’t try to include too many characters or
too many events – focus on one incident or
one problem.

TEXT
ASSIGNMENT
ANTHOLOGY:
B: IMAGINATIVE
FICTION WRITING

ACTIVITY 5

▼ BEGINNING, MIDDLE AND END
However long or short, all stories will have a beginning, a middle and
an end. The beginning should preferably have a narrative hook that
makes the reader want to read on (for example, in ‘Escape’, we wanted
to know who he was and what he was escaping from). The ending need
not be a full conclusion, especially in a very short story, but it should
give the reader some sense of resolution.

ACTIVITY 6

▼ PLANNING YOUR STORY’S BEGINNING, MIDDLE AND END
Summarise how you think your story will begin, develop and end.
When you finish writing your story, compare your original plan with the
finished story. What has changed? What worked out as you expected?

What type of story have you found easiest, or perhaps most enjoyable, to write
in the past? Choose two from the list below.
Genre:
◼◼ sci-fi
◼◼ fantasy
◼◼ war
◼◼ romance
◼◼ comedy
◼◼ thriller
◼◼ horror
◼◼ realism.
Because the title that you will be given will normally be one or two very general
words, it is likely that you will be able to relate the title to any genre. Imagine
that the title that you have been given is ‘The Decision’. Choose one of the two
genres that you selected from the list and jot down some ideas for a story in
that genre with that title. You could do this in a list or spider diagram. Include
details about:
◼◼ the main character
◼◼ the setting
◼◼ the situation
◼◼ the central incident or event
◼◼ a problem to solve
◼◼ the ending.
◀ Your favourite film genres may inspire you
to choose the genre of your writing: sci-fi,
romance, fantasy?

The following spider diagram is a plan for a simple realistic story entitled ‘The

Characters: Ant is quieter than others; one
of the new members is seen in distance but
they don’t meet him – reactions to him?

Describe: setting
near school – street

Situation: 15-year-old boy; problem
– is he going to go out with a group of
friends, though he doesn’t much like one
or two new members, and he is worried
that they will get them into trouble

Decides at end to go
with them, but might

Dialogue and thoughts
or feelings
This example is based on a very simple situation that may be familiar to you.
A lot of writers advise beginners to ‘write about what you know’, and this often
makes sense. An idea such as this might be one in which you can draw on
your own experience, and alter it as much as you like, and this will help you to
make the writing vivid and believable. However, you can see that a title such
as ‘The Decision’ could work in any genre at all.

CHARACTERISATION AND
PERSPECTIVE

Part of the planning process will involve thinking about your main character.
It is a good idea to tell the story from this character’s point of view, as this
will give the reader a strong sense of their personality. One of the things you
should decide quite quickly is whether to tell the story in the first or third
person. First person narrative is best if you want the reader to see everything
from your main character’s point of view, whereas third person narrative is best
if you want the reader to understand everything via an all-knowing narrator.
Once you have chosen your narrative perspective, copy and complete the
following table, filling it out with details about your main character.
Gender
Age
Ethnicity
Where from originally?
Living where (if different)?
Outgoing/shy?
Clever/average?
Pleased about what in life?
Upset about what in life?
How do they dress?
Class background?
What objects would you associate with them
(to do with work/hobbies/interests etc.)?
Problem in story?

EXAM PREPARATION

EXAM PREPARATION
SUCCESSFUL REVISION

Many books offer different suggestions and advice for revision. One thing is clear: not everything works for everyone.
Each person has particular ways of revising and habits of working. Look at all the advice and try out the different
suggestions. Decide clearly what the knowledge, skills and techniques you need to develop, consolidate or revisit are.

PLAN YOUR LEARNING AND REVISION
HOW TO PLAN A SCHEDULE
◼◼

Draw up a table to show the days and weeks before the examination.
Decide how much time to give to the subject in each week or day.
Work out a timetable.
Think about the need for variety and breaks.
Make sure your schedule is building towards a ‘peak’ at the right time.

HOW TO IMPROVE

Write answers to the time limits of questions in the actual examination.
Check that you understand all texts, looking at words, meaning, plot and character.
Revise technical terms, using a glossary.
Be sure you can apply these properly, spell them properly, give examples, and explain how and why they are used.

AIDS TO LEARNING

Write short, clear notes. Use aids such as:
◼◼ postcards
◼◼ diagrams
◼◼ flowcharts
◼◼ mnemonics (aids to memory, such as rhymes)
◼◼ computer programmes
◼◼ websites and apps

GOOD PREPARATION

Good preparation is one of the main elements affecting how people perform in examinations. This includes both attitude
of mind and physical preparation.
◼◼ Check how long the exam lasts and use your time properly.
◼◼ Make sure you understand your specification.
Don’t be tempted to rush the initial reading. It is surprising how many exam candidates make basic mistakes because
they did not read through the text in front of them properly.

EXAM PREPARATION

PLANNING YOUR ANSWERS
ANSWER THE QUESTION

Do not just write down everything you know: this is the most common mistake made by examination candidates.
Planning consists of the following elements:
◼◼ Reading the question carefully and deciding what the key words in it are.
◼◼ Deciding the main points you wish to make is, what the question is looking for and how you intend to tackle it.
◼◼ Making sure that what you want to include is appropriately positioned and structured in the answer.
◼◼ Giving your answer a structure: introduction, main section(s) and conclusion.
◼◼ Choosing examples or quotations.

THINKING ABOUT THE QUESTION

Identifying the key words in the question can help to show:
◼◼ what the question is looking for
◼◼ how you intend to tackle it.
Key words show what the examiner is expecting in setting this task. (There are sometimes bullet points to help you.) For
example:
◼◼ ‘HOW DOES THE WRITER’ is asking you to explain methods and techniques.
◼◼ ‘EXPLAIN’ asks you to make clear to the examiner your understanding of the text and its methods.
◼◼ ‘ANALYSE’ expects you to look in detail at the writing, its methods and techniques (again) and its effects.
◼◼ ‘COMPARE AND CONTRAST’ asks for an examination of similarities and differences in any relevant aspects (for
example, themes, moods, forms and language).

KEY POINTS

Write down quickly, in note form, your immediate thoughts about the subject. (You may find a diagram useful for this
purpose.) Do not write full sentences here, or you will waste too much time.

THE CONTENT OF THE ANSWER

The examiner does want to know what you think: your own, personal ideas and opinions. However, a series of
unsupported statements that start with the words ‘I think…’ is not enough, since the examiner also needs to know
what these ideas are based on: the analysis of Literature and content, the understanding of the subject-matter and the
evidence on which your views are based.

DECIDING THE STRUCTURE: INTRODUCTION, MAIN SECTION(S) AND CONCLUSION

INTRODUCTION: A clear, brief introductory paragraph can make a very good initial impression, showing the examiner that
you are thinking about the actual question.

MAIN SECTION(S): Decide how many paragraphs or sections you wish your answer to contain.
CONCLUSION: This may be quite a brief paragraph. It should sum up clearly and logically the argument that has gone
before. Above all, it should show the examiner that you have answered the question!

WRITING ANALYTICALLY

When writing analytically, whether for English Language or Literature, many students find it helpful to follow the
acronym:
P – Point
E – Evidence
E – Explanation
… to remind themselves to structure paragraphs, include quotations and then explain in some detail what it is about the
quotations that validates their point.
A slightly more advanced approach is to add ‘L’, for Link, ensuring a tight structure, so, P-E-E-L.

EXAM PREPARATION

CONFIDENTIAL: Uncorrected WIP proof, NOT for circulation or distribution. © Pearson Education.

EVALUATIVE COMMENTS

When reading Section A answers, analysing aspects of a text, examiners will always give more credit for some detailed
explanations of how the writer is using language, in which the student shows clearly that they have understood how
language is working, than for lists of mere ‘technique-spotting’. In other words, you will get few marks for just saying
that a writer uses short sentences and alliteration here and there; but if you can write a few lines on how a writer uses
language effectively in just one sentence, that is how you will boost your marks.

USING QUOTATIONS

When writing about English passages, whether books, poems, articles or extracts, one of the most important
techniques is to use quotations, where these are required and / or allowed. Quoting is a skill that has to be practised.
Overuse of quotations is as significant a mistake as not using any at all. You should use quotations especially for the
following reasons:
◼◼ To illustrate or give an example, for example, a simile or an instance of alliteration
◼◼ To explain why you believe something, to support an opinion or argument or to prove a point
Quotations should be relevant, effective and short: a single word to a line or two at the most. Introduce quotations
fluently into your sentence structure. Avoid saying, ‘He says…’.

LESS CAN BE MORE

If you can, practise doing Section B type questions, but never rush them. Just as you should concentrate on explaining
in some detail how a writer creates effects etc. for Section A, so in Section B your aim should not be to show how
much you can write, but to show that you can think as you write – think of ideas, paragraphing, sentence structure,
vocabulary, persuasive/rhetorical techniques and so on. Try to write with care!

LAST MINUTE REVISION

Think ahead. Revision the night or morning before an exam can be very useful, but generally only if you have done the
groundwork solidly and can therefore spend time looking at checklists, summative notes, mnemonics and a few of your
weak spots. It can be very helpful but it’s not a good idea, of course, to get into panic mode and revise into the small
hours because it suddenly hits home that you aren’t well prepared.

ON THE DAY OF THE EXAM

Again, checklists and mnemonics can be useful to consult as you go into school, as might reading through a model
answer or two. Always read the exam paper carefully all the way through, and look at the choices for Section B before
you start Section A. Many experienced teachers would advise taking some ‘mint-time’ (that is, the time it would take
a mint to dissolve in the mouth – and there is no reason why you should not take one just before you go into the exam
room) to read and think and make some notes, before you begin the first question. This can have the effect of steadying
the nerves as well as allowing you to think. (No chewing gum though!)

TIME WAITS FOR NO-ONE!

English departments vary in how much they organise exam question practice against the clock for classes. And you
may not have minded this at all. But the fact is that it’s invaluable practice for the real thing, which is always a race
against time. What is essential is that you divide your time up carefully in the exam: many students will find it harder
to answer Section A with enough detail and accuracy than to complete a reasonable answer to Section B, so if you
are finding it slow going, you can allow more time for Section A, then aim to complete Section B in about 50 minutes
(especially if you decided on the Section B task earlier on). Remember that the Section A questions are marked against
detailed mark schemes of what should be in the answers (examples of which your teacher can show you), whereas
Section B questions are marked on more general guidelines. And there is no insistence on a certain length of answer,
which means that you can gain good marks with a carefully written answer of 400 words.
Good luck!
